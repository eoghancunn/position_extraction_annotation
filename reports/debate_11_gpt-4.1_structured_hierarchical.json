{"summary": "**Actionable Report: Parliamentary Debate on \u201cThe European Forest Strategy \u2013 The Way Forward\u201d**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Debate Information\n\n- **Date:** 6 October 2020\n- **Topic:** The European Forest Strategy \u2013 The Way Forward\n- **Contributions:** Over 30 speakers from major political groups (EPP, S&D, Renew, Greens/EFA, ECR, GUE/NGL, ID, NI), including the European Commission and various national delegations.\n- **Context:** The debate addressed the development of the post-2020 EU Forest Strategy in the context of the European Green Deal, Biodiversity Strategy, and critical threats facing European forests (climate change, biodiversity loss, rural depopulation, and illegal logging).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Executive Summary\n\n#### **A. GENERAL CONSENSUS AND SHARED CONCERNS**\n\nMost speakers agreed that Europe\u2019s forests are central to the EU\u2019s climate neutrality, biodiversity and rural development objectives. As Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski emphasized, the new strategy should be \u201cholistic and multifunctional, making forests instruments for both climate action and rural vitality\u201d [Wojciechowski, 2020-10-06].\n\nSeveral MEPs expressed alarm at the state of Europe\u2019s forests: \u201cOnly 15% of European forests are in favorable conservation status. We must urgently restore what\u2019s left,\u201d urged Delara Burkhardt [Burkhardt, 2020-10-06]. Others stressed forests\u2019 role as \u201cthe green lungs of Europe\u201d [Martin H\u00e4usling, 2020-10-06] and called for more robust responses to threats from fires, pests, and illegal logging.\n\nThere was overwhelming endorsement of the principle that the future strategy should strike a balance between:\n\n- **Environmental integrity (climate, biodiversity, water regulation)**\n- **Socio-economic benefits (jobs, rural livelihoods, circular bioeconomy)**\n- **Cultural and community values**\n\n#### **B. KEY AREAS OF DEBATE**\n\n##### 1. **Protection vs. Sustainable Use**\n\n- **Strict protection advocates** (notably Jutta Paulus, Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg, Michal Wiezik, Marisa Matias) argued for science-based, legally enforceable measures: \u201cLet\u2019s end clear-cutting, industrial monocultures, and the fiction that burning wood is \u2018climate neutral\u2019\u201d [Paulus, 2020-10-06]. They opposed the economic orientation of current policy, pushing for \u201cstrict reserves and restoration of primary and old-growth forests as the backbone of the new strategy\u201d [Wiezik, 2020-10-06].\n- **Pragmatic multifunctionality defenders** (Simone Schmiedtbauer, Franc Bogovi\u010d, Marlene Mortler) supported \u201csustainable, multifunctional, nature-based forest management\u201d and warned \u201cwe should not make our forests \u2018static natural museums\u2019 but manage them actively and adaptively\u201d [Schmiedtbauer, 2020-10-06]. They touted models from Finland and Sweden as proof of \u201chow managed forests have delivered both economic and environmental gains\u201d [Mortler, 2020-10-06].\n\n##### 2. **EU Competence vs. National Sovereignty**\n\n- A visible divide arose over governance. Several, including Beata Mazurek and Karin Karlsbro, warned: \u201cForestry is a national competence and one-size-fits-all rules from Brussels would be counterproductive\u201d [Mazurek, 2020-10-06]. Gilles Lebreton asserted: \u201cDon\u2019t deprive Member States of their constitutional rights to manage their forests!\u201d [Lebreton, 2020-10-06].\n- By contrast, proponents of a strong EU role (Clara Aguilera, Carmen Avram, Daniel Buda) called for harmonization to tackle cross-border threats. \u201cClimate change, pests, illegal logging\u2014they don\u2019t respect borders. That\u2019s why we need a true European Strategy\u201d [Aguilera, 2020-10-06].\n\n##### 3. **Biomass and Wood as Energy Sources**\n\n- The role of forests in the bioeconomy, particularly the use of wood for energy, was hotly contested.\n    - Critics such as Martin H\u00e4usling and Marie Toussaint rejected \u201cthe fallacy that burning wood is carbon neutral\u201d [H\u00e4usling, 2020-10-06]; \u201cSubsidies for biomass must go\u201d [Toussaint, 2020-10-06]. \n    - Supporters like Petri Sarvamaa and Simone Schmiedtbauer countered that \u201cforests and timber products are indispensable to a climate-friendly, circular economy\u201d [Sarvamaa, 2020-10-06].\n\n##### 4. **Socio-Economic Development and Rural Areas**\n\n- Many highlighted the sector\u2019s role in revitalizing rural economies and communities: \u201cForests provide jobs, income, and hope to millions in rural Europe. Their sustainable use must continue,\u201d affirmed Francisco Mill\u00e1n Mon [Mill\u00e1n Mon, 2020-10-06].\n- Carmen Avram advocated robust action against illegal logging: \u201cTraceability of timber and real action against timber mafias are urgently needed\u201d [Avram, 2020-10-06].\n- Ivan Vilibor Sin\u010di\u0107 even linked illegal deforestation to poverty, proposing a Universal Basic Income as a preventive tool: \u201cLet\u2019s address root causes\u2014ending poverty-driven illegal logging through a basic income for all\u201d [Sin\u010di\u0107, 2020-10-06].\n\n##### 5. **Incentives, Funding and Agricultural Policy**\n\n- Speakers like Cristian Ghinea called for \u201crevising the CAP so that afforestation and sustainable forestry become attractive, not penalized\u201d [Ghinea, 2020-10-06]. There was consensus on the need for increased investment in innovation, traceability, and disaster management, with several emphasizing: \u201cLet\u2019s use the farm funds, structural funds, and research budget to boost sustainable forestry and forest-based jobs\u201d [De Castro, 2020-10-06].\n\n##### 6. **External Deforestation and Trade Policy**\n\n- As Ir\u00e8ne Tolleret put it: \u201cThe EU must stop importing deforestation\u2014no more trading with partners that don\u2019t respect forests\u201d [Tolleret, 2020-10-06]. The need for trade policies aligned with forest protection and global sustainability standards was widely underlined.\n\n---\n\n#### **C. INTEGRATED POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS EMERGING FROM THE DEBATE**\n\n1. **Strengthen the multifunctionality principle**\u2014embedding ecological, economic, and social values in all policy levers.\n2. **Support strict protection and targeted restoration**\u2014especially for primary and old-growth forests, with robust monitoring and enforcement.\n3. **Incentivize sustainable management and climate resilience**\u2014promoting mixed-species forestry, agroforestry, and disaster risk reduction.\n4. **Ensure fair funding and economic incentives** for rural actors, and close loopholes in CAP that disincentivize forest expansion.\n5. **Improve traceability and enforcement**\u2014using new tools against illegal logging and cross-border timber crime.\n6. **Leverage EU trade policy** to block imports driving deforestation, and include forest criteria in all external agreements.\n7. **Foster genuine EU\u2013Member State cooperation**\u2014building a strategy that enables EU-wide action where necessary, but harnesses national expertise, context, and innovation.\n\n---\n\n### **D. CONCLUSION**\n\nThe debate showed a shared sense of urgency and a vision for a balanced, sustainable future for Europe\u2019s forests, with strong calls for \u201cintegration with the Green Deal, full respect for local realities, and ambitious but achievable protection goals\u201d [Paet, 2020-10-06]. However, \u201cthe meaning of \u2018balance\u2019 differs\u201d\u2014for some it is \u201cmore protection, less production,\u201d for others, \u201cintegration of economic and conservation goals, steered by local expertise\u201d [M\u00fcller, 2020-10-06].\n\nThe outcome is a call for a strategy that is \u201cambitious, well-funded, and grounded both in European objectives and the rich diversity of local forestry traditions, providing benefits for climate, biodiversity, rural prosperity, and future generations\u201d [Summary]. The challenge ahead is to convert these principles into a coherent, actionable EU Forest Strategy that bridges differences and addresses the climate and biodiversity crises, without neglecting socio-economic and cultural values."}
