Both because I am against the proposal and the relaxations, but certainly also because I know what kind of policy you are trying to impose on the countries of Europe\" [Peter KOFOD, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Kostas PAPADAKIS (NI):**  \nCondemned the Directive as a tool for \"savage class exploitation\" and repression of migrants:  \n\"Promoting blue cards...so-called circular migration and more, i.e. savage class exploitation to serve the profitability of European groups\" [Kostas PAPADAKIS, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Gilles LEBRETON (ID):**  \nAttacked reliance on labor immigration for demographic issues, urging birth policies instead:  \n\"To resolve this demographic crisis, the EU is making the mistake of seeking to encourage emigration, whereas it would be far preferable to encourage birth policies\" [Gilles LEBRETON, 2021-09-14].\n\n**\u00c1d\u00e1m K\u00d3SA (NI):**  \nCalled for prioritizing youth employment and training over skilled migration, labeling current behavior \"hypocritical\" [\u00c1d\u00e1m K\u00d3SA, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Bal\u00e1zs HIDV\u00c9GHI (NI):**  \nCriticized centralization, advocated Member State autonomy, and preferred national family support over migration:  \n\"It is not common European rules and stronger Brussels powers, but to give the right of decision back to the Member States\" [Bal\u00e1zs HIDV\u00c9GHI, 2021-09-14].\n\n---\n\n### **Key Recommendations and Areas for Follow-up**\n\n- **Promote a broader, more ambitious, and inclusive legal migration policy** (including medium- and lower-skilled workers and international protection beneficiaries) while monitoring potential impacts on domestic labor markets.\n- **Commit to substantially reducing bureaucratic barriers and processing times** to make the Blue Card genuinely competitive globally.\n- **Ensure strong safeguards against social dumping and exploitation** and uphold equal treatment for Blue Card holders and their families.\n- **Protect Member State autonomy** and address concerns about brain drain, demographic policy, and the cultural impact of migration through dialogue and flexibility.\n- **Capitalize on reform momentum** to advance further proposals in legal migration and asylum policy, considering both economic needs and human rights dimensions.\n\n---\n\nThis debate reveals a majority in Parliament recognizing the need for an updated, more attractive EU Blue Card system but shows enduring contention regarding national sovereignty, social impact, and the inclusiveness of EU migration policy. Ongoing attention to labor market needs, harmonization with national systems, and rights of all migrants will remain essential as the reform is implemented."}
