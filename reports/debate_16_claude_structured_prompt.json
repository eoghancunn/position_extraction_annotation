{"summary": "# Executive Summary: Prohibiting Chick and Duckling Killing in EU Law\n\n## 1. Debate Information\n\n**Date:** May 11, 2023  \n**Number of Contributions:** 19 speakers (including repeat appearances by some MEPs)  \n**Topic:** Debate on prohibiting the killing of day-old male chicks in the egg industry and female ducklings in the foie gras industry across the EU  \n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe European Parliament debate focused on the practice of culling approximately 330 million day-old male chicks annually in the EU egg industry, along with millions of female ducklings in the foie gras industry. Male chicks are killed because they cannot produce eggs, while female ducklings are killed because they are not suitable for foie gras production. The killing methods include maceration (grinding), gassing, and asphyxiation.\n\n### Key Issues\n\nSirpa Pietik\u00e4inen highlighted the ethical concerns, noting the practice contradicts the EU's treaty obligations to treat animals as sentient beings. She characterized the methods as brutal, saying: \"This is wrong. This is unethical. And this is a huge waste of protein\" [Pietik\u00e4inen, 2023-05-11].\n\nSe\u00e1n Kelly described the scale of the problem: \"This horrible, barbaric practice where 300 million day-old male chicks are killed every year in the EU and 6.5 billion worldwide\" [Kelly, 2023-05-11]. He emphasized that these deaths \"often caused immense suffering, including via maceration, electrocution and asphyxiation.\"\n\nCommissioner Valdis Dombrovskis acknowledged the ethical concerns but noted the different contexts between chick culling in the egg industry and duckling culling in the foie gras sector. He stated: \"The systematic killing of millions of day-old chickens and day-old ducklings raises major ethical concerns for many people\" [Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11].\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\nMost MEPs strongly condemned the practice as cruel and unnecessary, with Tilly Metz asserting that \"The killing of day-old chicks is an inhumane practice that causes immense suffering and violates the basic animal welfare laws enshrined in EU law\" [Metz, 2023-05-11].\n\nMichal Wiezik emphasized the emotional impact, sharing: \"When I first saw the documentary on the killing of day-old chicks, I was shocked. The natural tendency to protect the tiny chick was confronted with the harsh reality of that little beeping bird being thrown into a grinder and crushed in a split second\" [Wiezik, 2023-05-11].\n\nSeveral MEPs, including Niels Fuglsang, argued that modern technology makes the practice unnecessary: \"There are methods today to determine whether a chicken is male or female before it hatches, so let's use those methods\" [Fuglsang, 2023-05-11].\n\nCarmen Avram argued that this issue transcends legislation: \"This issue should not even be about legislation. It is simply a question of morality and adapting to new realities\" [Avram, 2023-05-11].\n\nSome speakers took more cautious positions. Anna Zalewska emphasized the need for \"balance between animal welfare and economic realities,\" stating: \"We must be responsible. We must investigate each case. We need to analyze the current regulations, as well as how to support entrepreneurs\" [Zalewska, 2023-05-11].\n\nAngel Dzhambazki questioned the prioritization of this issue and raised concerns about economic impacts: \"What will be the cost to the taxpayers, first of all, and second, for the industry?\" [Dzhambazki, 2023-05-11].\n\nJoaquim Kuhs expressed opposition to chick culling while warning against using this issue to advocate for restricting the entire poultry sector: \"We all want and demand a swift end to this practice, but when interested groups misuse this issue on the flimsy grounds of climate protection to call for a ban on the entire poultry sector, it is simply hypocritical\" [Kuhs, 2023-05-11].\n\n### Proposals and Solutions\n\nMany MEPs called for an immediate EU-wide ban on both male chick and female duckling culling. P\u00e4r Holmgren insisted that \"A total ban must be included in the upcoming animal welfare legislation. Full stop, with no exemptions\" [Holmgren, 2023-05-11].\n\nClare Daly proposed extending the ban to imports: \"We need to speed up this process, deliver a full EU-wide ban to stop people exploiting the borders to continue this process\" [Daly, 2023-05-11].\n\nSeveral speakers highlighted that France, Germany, Austria, and Italy have already implemented bans on chick culling, creating an uneven playing field. Wiezik noted that \"Hatcheries in countries where killing male chicks is forbidden started to export day-old chicks to kill them in neighbouring countries\" [Wiezik, 2023-05-11].\n\nMany MEPs emphasized in-egg sexing technology as the primary alternative. Pietik\u00e4inen explained: \"With quite marginal extra cost, we could already scan through the eggs and decide to consume the eggs of male chickens instead of destroying chicklets just after they are born\" [Pietik\u00e4inen, 2023-05-11].\n\nCarmen Avram proposed concrete supporting measures: 1) European Commission assistance to provide access to chick sexing technology; 2) Increased research funding; 3) Subsidies for implementing new technologies; 4) Creation of a cross-sectoral dialogue group; 5) Political ownership beyond CAP funding; and 6) Announcing funding before legislative measures [Avram, 2023-05-11].\n\nCommissioner Dombrovskis confirmed that the Commission is \"committed to proposing ambitious legislation that matches the latest science with social and economic realities\" [Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11], while noting that any ban would include transitional periods and consider economic impacts.\n\nThe debate revealed broad opposition to the practice of culling day-old chicks and ducklings, with most speakers supporting an EU-wide ban while differing on implementation timing, economic considerations, and the approach to the foie gras sector. The discussion highlighted the tension between animal welfare, technological alternatives, economic concerns, and cultural traditions in EU policy-making."}
