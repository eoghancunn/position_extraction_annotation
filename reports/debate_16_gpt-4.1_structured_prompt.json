{"summary": "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE ON \"PROHIBITING CHICK AND DUCKLING KILLING IN EU LAW\"**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Debate Information\n\n**Date:** 11 May 2023  \n**Topic:** Prohibiting chick and duckling killing in EU law  \n**Number of Contributions:** 17 substantive contributions  \n**Context:** The debate centers on the ethical, economic, and legislative facets of banning the systematic killing of day-old male chicks and female ducklings across the European Union. The issue intersects animal welfare, agricultural practice, economic feasibility, technological innovation, and societal values.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Executive Summary\n\n**Overview:**\nThe parliamentary debate reveals strong cross-party condemnation of the current practice of killing day-old chicks and ducklings, with the notable convergence toward enacting a legislative ban at the EU level. Nevertheless, significant differences exist regarding the timetable, the scope of the ban, the need for transition periods, economic and sectoral impacts, consideration for cultural heritage (notably foie gras production), and the necessity of robust support for implementation. Proponents urge immediate action and robust legislation, while some members highlight potential negative impacts on producers and the need for careful assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Speaker Analysis and Thematic Comparison**\n\n**1. Sirpa Pietik\u00e4inen (PPE):**  \nFirmly condemns the killing as \"inhumane and unethical,\" stressing legal, ethical, and practical imperatives. She urges the Commission for a clear \"timetable\" for prohibition and highlights alternatives like \"egg scanning\" and raising male chicks for protein, suggesting these methods incur \"quite marginal extra cost.\" She frames the debate as both a \"huge waste of protein\" and an ethical duty under EU treaties [Pietik\u00e4inen, 2023-05-11].\n\n**2. Valdis Dombrovskis (Commission):**  \nAcknowledges \"major ethical concerns for many people,\" and states the Commission is considering a phase-out as part of the \"ongoing impact assessment for the revision of the EU's animal welfare legislation.\" He warns against market distortion, emphasizing the necessity to \"balance ethics, economics, and practical realities.\" Dombrovskis says bans in sectors like foie gras are complicated by traditions and a lack of evidence of market harm [Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11].\n\n**3. Se\u00e1n Kelly (PPE):**  \nDescribes the practice as a \"barbaric practice\" affecting \"300 million day-old male chicks ... killed every year in the EU\" and calls for an \"EU-wide ban.\" Citing \"overwhelming public opinion,\" he urges the EU to follow countries with existing bans and adopt \"in-vitro egg sexing technology\" [Kelly, 2023-05-11].\n\n**4. Carmen Avram (S&D):**  \nLabels the practice \"barbaric\" and asserts that the issue is not merely legislative but a \"question of morality.\" Advocates increased \"EU funding\" for alternatives, sectoral subsidies, and the formation of a \"cross-sectoral dialogue group.\" Avram emphasizes providing \"financial predictability before imposing new legislative mandates\" [Avram, 2023-05-11].\n\n**5. Michal Wiezik (Renew):**  \nCondemns the practice as \"cruel and unacceptable,\" and warns against circumventing bans by \"exporting live chicks for elimination.\" Advocates for \"minimal transition periods,\" bans on related exports/imports, and broadening protections to ducklings used in foie gras [Wiezik, 2023-05-11].\n\n**6. Tilly Metz (Verts/ALE):**  \nCalls the killing \"inhumane\" and out of step with \"basic animal welfare laws.\" Demands an \"immediate ... EU-wide ban\" without \"long transitional phases,\" citing both EFSA's scientific stance and public expectation [Metz, 2023-05-11].\n\n**7. Anna Zalewska (ECR):**  \nWelcomes discussion but cautions for a \"responsible and balanced\" approach. Recommends \"investigating each case,\" reviewing \"current regulations,\" and considering economic impact. Praise is given to the Commission's cautious stance and to \"innovations in Germany and France\" as models [Zalewska, 2023-05-11].\n\n**8. Joachim Kuhs (ID):**  \nUnequivocally opposes chick and duckling killing but is wary of \"using this issue ... to call for a ban on the entire poultry sector,\" warning of negative impacts if production moves abroad to countries with lower standards. Emphasizes \"rational, fact-based decision-making\" [Kuhs, 2023-05-11].\n\n**9. Niels Fuglsang (S&D):**  \nDescribes the killing as \"barbaric\" and dismisses \"cultural\" or \"economic\" justifications as invalid given the availability of \"pre-hatch gender determination technology,\" which he says has \"no significant cost increase.\" Recommends a \"European-level ban\" [Fuglsang, 2023-05-11].\n\n**10. Caroline Roose (Verts/ALE):**  \nArgues that the practice is unnecessary due to \"alternatives such as sexing in the egg\" and that citizens \"expect action\" from the Commission. Calls for a ban on both male chick and female duckling killing [Roose, 2023-05-11].\n\n**11. Angel Dzhambazki (ECR):**  \nRaises \"economic implications,\" expressing concern over \"regulation, administration, red tape,\" and possible \"destruction of ... European industries\" in favor of imports. Skeptical about prioritizing animal welfare over the economic and social costs to producers [Dzhambazki, 2023-05-11].\n\n**12. P\u00e4r Holmgren (Verts/ALE):**  \nDemands a \"full ban at EU level\" with \"no exemptions,\" citing that \"at least 80%\" of citizens \"find this cruel killing for profit inexcusable.\" Stresses both public support and technological capability [Holmgren, 2023-05-11].\n\n**13. Clare Daly (The Left):**  \nCalls the practice \"horrific, wanton cruelty\" and insists that \"economic assessments should not override animal welfare.\" Urges \"urgent harmonized action\" to prevent cross-border regulatory arbitrage and suggests import bans from non-compliant countries [Daly, 2023-05-11].\n\n**14. Mick Wallace (The Left):**  \nCriticizes the \"big agri-lobby\" for diluting animal welfare reforms and calls for a \"strong, exemption-free\" ban. Warns that \"exemptions lobbied by the big agri-industry\" could undermine the effectiveness of legislation [Wallace, 2023-05-11].\n\n---\n\n#### **Key Themes and Areas of Agreement:**\n\n- **Moral & Ethical Consensus:** There is strong cross-spectrum condemnation of the practice as \"inhumane,\" \"unethical,\" \"barbaric\" (Pietik\u00e4inen, Kelly, Metz, Holmgren, Daly, Roose, Wiezik).\n- **Technology & Alternatives:** There is wide acknowledgment of \"egg sexing\" and \"pre-hatch gender determination\" as viable and increasingly cost-effective alternatives (Pietik\u00e4inen, Kelly, Fuglsang, Roose, Avram).\n- **Legislative Action:** Most speakers support an EU-wide ban integrated into animal welfare law, though disagreement exists regarding timing, scope, and exemptions.\n- **Public Support:** Several speakers stress overwhelming public demand for reform (Holmgren: \"at least 80%... find this cruel killing for profit inexcusable\" [Holmgren, 2023-05-11]).\n- **Economic Considerations:** Some raise caution about the speed and scope of a ban, advocating for \"impact assessments,\" \"responsible and balanced\" processes, and sectoral support to prevent harming EU producers (Dombrovskis, Zalewska, Dzhambazki).\n\n#### **Key Points of Disagreement:**\n\n- **Transition Periods vs. Immediate Ban:** While Metz, Holmgren, and Wiezik press for immediate action, Dombrovskis and Zalewska endorse careful, phased, or impact-assessed approaches.\n- **Economic vs. Moral Prioritization:** Avram and Daly argue that morality should override economics, while Dzhambazki, Zalewska, and Kuhs stress possible unintended economic harm.\n- **Sectoral & Cultural Exemptions:** Dombrovskis suggests protections for foie gras production due to \"regional traditions\" and limited \"market distortion,\" whereas several others (e.g., Holmgren, Daly, Wallace) call for a full ban with \"no exemptions.\"\n- **Scope of Policy:** Wiezik and Daly call for bans on both exports and imports relating to non-compliant practices, while Kuhs warns against sectoral bans altogether and Dzhambazki questions the regulatory focus.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusions & Actionable Recommendations**\n\n1. **Legislative Action is Urgently Expected:** The Commission should expedite proposals to ban the killing of day-old chicks and ducklings, reflecting both ethical imperatives and technological readiness. A concrete timetable, as requested by multiple speakers, is crucial.\n2. **Immediate Integration of Alternative Technologies:** Policies and funding should prioritize rapid deployment of alternatives such as in-ovo sexing, with sectoral support to ensure swift transition, minimize economic disruption, and harmonize standards EU-wide.\n3. **Economic and Social Impact Mitigation:** A transition support framework is advised, consisting of funding for alternative technologies, financial aid for affected producers, and stakeholder consultation.\n4. **Strict Harmonization and Enforcement:** Legislation must prevent regulatory loopholes, such as cross-border export for culling. Consider harmonized import restrictions to ensure coherence.\n5. **Address Sectoral/National Interests Transparently:** The Commission must balance cultural heritage (e.g., foie gras) with animal welfare and public expectations, ensuring transparency in legislative exemptions or sectoral provisions.\n6. **Monitor Lobbying Influence:** The integrity of animal welfare legislation must be shielded from undue industry influence and potential dilution of reforms.\n\n**Overall, the debate reveals a robust consensus for reforming the status quo on animal ethics, underpinned by technological feasibility and broad public support, while emphasizing the necessity of judicious implementation to support both societal values and economic sustainability.**"}
