The Argument for Addressing Socio-Economic Roots**\n\nSpeakers from The Left such as **Marc Botenga** and **Sira Rego** emphasized the economic and social roots of radicalization, warning that anger from economic hardship is too often redirected towards minorities instead of being addressed through policy reform.\n\n- **Marc Botenga** stated, \u201cThe far right wants to channel\u2026people\u2019s anger not against\u2026billionaires but against migrants and trade unions\u201d [Botenga, 2021-10-20].\n- **Sira Rego** advocated for \u201cextirpating far-right narratives, strengthening the social state, and guaranteeing rights for everyone\u201d as preventative measures [Rego, 2021-10-20].\n- **Kostas Papadakis** accused the EU of hypocrisy for anti-communism and failure to address structural causes like capitalism [Papadakis, 2021-10-20].\n\n**6.

Democracy\u2019s Limits vis-\u00e0-vis Extremist Participation**\n\n**Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zdechovsk\u00fd** and **Marek Belka** noted the risk of permitting extremes (right or left) too much influence. \u201cDemocracy is a fragile thing\u2026We want pluralism, but it is not acceptable for someone to come up with extreme views\u2026\u201d [Zdechovsk\u00fd, 2021-10-20].\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations for Action**\n\n- **Strengthen Cohesive, EU-Wide Legal Action** against all forms of right-wing extremist violence, through banning extremist organizations, enhancing law enforcement coordination, and criminalizing hate speech online and offline.\n- **Develop Robust Educational and Cultural Interventions** spanning schools, media literacy, and public memory to address the generational transmission of extremist ideologies.\n- **Foster Cross-Party Unity**: All mainstream democratic parties should unequivocally distance themselves from extremist groups and rhetoric, avoiding ambiguous stances.\n- **Address Socio-Economic Drivers**: EU and Member States should invest in economic support, employment, and social inclusion to neutralize the root causes exploited by extremists.\n- **Guard Against All Extremisms While Recognizing Current Threats**: While other forms of extremism exist, recent events justify vigilant, focused action against right-wing violence and racism; debates should reflect proportionality based on evidence.\n- **Enforce Existing Laws and Monitor Implementation**: Member States must be held to account for enforcement of anti-extremism and anti-racism laws, with the EU playing a constructive, supportive, and monitoring role.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, the debate exposed deep divisions over the framing of extremist threats but confirmed broad consensus (outside of a few dissenters) on the urgent need for united, concrete action to defend Europe\u2019s democratic values from the mounting danger of right-wing extremism and racism. The Parliament is called to move \u201cnot only through words, but with concrete actions\u201d [Dalli, 2021-10-20]."}
