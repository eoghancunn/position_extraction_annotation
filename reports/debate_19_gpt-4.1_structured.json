Debate Information\n\n- **Topic:** Police brutality within the EU\n- **Date:** 20 October 2020\n- **Number of Contributions:** 27 (from Speaker 2 to Speaker 28; some numbers omitted)\n- **Setting:** European Parliament plenary debate\n\n---\n\n### 2. Executive Summary\n\n#### **Overview**\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s debate on police brutality within the EU was wide-ranging and passionate, triggered in large part by high-profile incidents such as the death of Jozef Chovanec in Belgium, the killing of George Floyd in the USA, and ongoing concerns regarding disproportionate police responses, discrimination, and institutional racism within Member States\u2019 law enforcement agencies. The debate revealed broad consensus regarding the need for accountability and adherence to the rule of law, but significant divergence over the framing of the issue, the scale of the problem, and the appropriate balance between supporting police and scrutinizing their conduct.\n\n#### **Key Themes and Issues**\n\n**1. Acknowledging and Addressing Police Brutality**\n\nMultiple speakers recognized police brutality as a systemic issue requiring urgent attention, greater accountability, and reform at both national and EU levels. Michael Roth stressed the EU\u2019s duty to ensure \"the use of force by law enforcement authorities must always be lawful, proportionate, necessary and a last resort\" [Roth, 2020-10-20], urging Member States to \"review the security authorities...to see where there is a need for readjustment\" [Roth, 2020-10-20]. Ylva Johansson condemned \"all forms of illegal or disproportionate use of violence and discriminatory practices by law enforcement authorities\" [Johansson, 2020-10-20], highlighting the need for zero tolerance of racial violence.\n\nVladim\u00edr Bil\u010d\u00edk and Ivan \u0160tefanec both referenced the Chovanec case to highlight failures in police accountability and called for comprehensive investigations. Bil\u010d\u00edk argued, \"The test of true Europeanness is...our ability to stand up directly and face up to all tragic cases of police brutality\" [Bil\u010d\u00edk, 2020-10-20]. Johansson reiterated \"each incident...should be systematically subject to an in-depth administrative or judicial inquiry\" [Johansson, 2020-10-20].\n\n**2. The Threat of Racism, Extremism, and Discrimination within Police Forces**\n\nSpeakers including Birgit Sippel, Diana Riba i Giner, Robert Haj\u0161el, and Sylwia Spurek raised concerns over right-wing extremism and institutional racism in law enforcement. Sippel called for \"independent studies on extremism in the police everywhere,\" warning, \"Racism and extremism endanger our democracy and must therefore be combated in all areas of our society\" [Sippel, 2020-10-20]. Riba i Giner and Spurek highlighted abuses targeting minorities, with Riba i Giner proposing \"the creation of an independent system for monitoring police violence within the Rule of Law mechanism\" [Riba i Giner, 2020-10-20].\n\nJohansson added, \"No institution is immune. Not the Commission, not the Parliament, not the police\" [Johansson, 2020-10-20], underlining the need for institutional self-examination.\n\n**3. Trust, Oversight, and Accountability**\n\nA frequent theme was the erosion of public trust due to lack of transparency and accountability. Sophia IN 'T VELD identified impunity as the dividing line between democracy and authoritarian rule: \"there is no impunity for excessive police violence\" [IN 'T VELD, 2020-10-20], and called for a \"European police code of ethics\" and improved police training. Lucia \u010euri\u0161 Nicholsonov\u00e1 and Alviina Alamets\u00e4 both argued for independent oversight mechanisms, with Alamets\u00e4 stating, \"If the police is tasked to regulate itself, as it often is, there is a conflict of interest\" [Alamets\u00e4, 2020-10-20].\n\nKathleen Van Brempt pointed to inadequate data, arguing, \"We don't actually have a good view of those numbers and that's a real problem\" [Van Brempt, 2020-10-20], reinforcing the need for greater data transparency.\n\n**4. Calls for Justice and EU-Level Action**\n\nMany speakers emphasized the need for EU action rather than solely national accountability. Michal \u0160ime\u010dka asserted, \"Europol should look into the actions of police officers and police training across the EU to make sure that EU citizens receive equal treatment\" [\u0160ime\u010dka, 2020-10-20]. Michael Roth noted that \"Member States also have a responsibility under our treaties...for all cases to be investigated in accordance with the rule of law procedures\" [Roth, 2020-10-20]. Daly, Haj\u0161el, and Com\u00edn i Oliveres criticized the lack of appropriate response to police excesses in the EU and called for institution-driven change.\n\n**5. Defending and Supporting Police Forces**\n\nA minority of speakers, including Lars Patrick Berg, Silvia Sardone, Joachim Stanis\u0142aw Brudzi\u0144ski, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rivi\u00e8re, argued against broad condemnation of police forces. Berg urged, \"Our job as politicians should be to back our police, not stab them in the back\" [Berg, 2020-10-20], and Sardone criticized \"those who, in her view, defend individuals accused of criminal behavior over the police\" [Sardone, 2020-10-20]. Brudzi\u0144ski cautioned, \"This is undeniably appalling and condemnable behavior, but it cannot authorize generalization and unfair assessment of thousands of hard-working...police officers\" [Brudzi\u0144ski, 2020-10-20].\n\n**6. Alleged Double Standards and Political Narratives**\n\nSome speakers, such as Angel Dzhambazki, El\u017cbieta Kruk, and Antoni Com\u00edn i Oliveres, accused the EU of double standards in condemning police brutality, suggesting that the EU reacts selectively depending on the country or political context. Dzhambazki argued, \"That is the double standard\" [Dzhambazki, 2020-10-20]. Kruk asked, \"Such cases occur...but surprisingly they are not accused of violating the rule of law. I ask whether we will live to see a debate in the EP about violations of the rule of law in these countries\" [Kruk, 2020-10-20].\n\nRivi\u00e8re and Jaki contended that the debate exaggerates the issue in certain countries, with Rivi\u00e8re stating, \"this fight against terrorism, not police violence, that we should be debating\" [Rivi\u00e8re, 2020-10-20].\n\n#### **Proposals and Solutions**\n\nThe debate generated several actionable proposals:\n\n- **Independent Oversight & Investigations:** Multiple speakers (Sippel, \u010euri\u0161 Nicholsonov\u00e1, Alamets\u00e4, Johansson) advocated for the creation and strengthening of independent investigations and external oversight bodies at both national and EU levels.\n- **Improved Data Collection:** Calls for better data on police arrests, violence, and misconduct (Van Brempt, \u010euri\u0161 Nicholsonov\u00e1).\n- **EU-Wide Code of Ethics and Training:** Proposals for a European code of ethics and expanded human rights/anti-discrimination law enforcement training (IN 'T VELD, Johansson, Roth).\n- **Judicial Remedies, Accountability, and Reparations:** Systematic inquiries, robust judicial review, and effective legal remedies for victims (Johansson, Bil\u010d\u00edk, \u0160tefanec, Van Brempt).\n- **Special Attention to Minority and Vulnerable Groups:** Enhanced protection and investigation of abuses against ethnic minorities, migrants, the Roma, and LGBT+ communities (Riba i Giner, Spurek, Daly).\n- **Rule of Law Monitoring:** Calls for police violence to be included in wider EU mechanisms for monitoring democracy and rule of law compliance (Johansson, Riba i Giner, \u0160ime\u010dka).\n- **Support for Policemen & Women:** Several speakers urged support for front-line police while maintaining calls for higher standards and accountability (Brudzi\u0144ski, Kanko, Sardone).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Recommendations**\n\nThe debate documented a clear recognition of the issue of police brutality within the EU, underscored by cross-party agreement on the need for greater transparency, accountability, and action\u2014tempered by calls for fairness towards law-abiding police officers and vigilance against political manipulation. Major actionable steps include establishing independent oversight at the EU and Member State levels, mandating standardized data collection, enhancing joint training in ethics and rights, and reinforcing judicial remedies for victims. EU institutions are urged to lead unequivocally, deploying their legislative and oversight powers to guarantee that policing across Europe remains closely aligned with democratic and human rights principles.\n\n**Key Recommendation:** Parliament should establish an EU-level independent monitoring and investigation mechanism, integrate police brutality concerns into existing rule of law frameworks, and ensure regular reporting on progress in tackling systemic abuses and promoting trust between police and communities across Member States."}
