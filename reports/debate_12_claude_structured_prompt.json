Debate Information\n- **Date**: September\n 14, 2021\n- **Topic**: EU Blue Card Directive\n- **Number of Contributions**: 23 substantive contributions from MEPs and the Commissioner\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThis debate centered on the revision of the EU Blue Card Directive, aimed at creating more accessible pathways for highly skilled third-country nationals to work in the European Union. After three years of deadlock in negotiations, a political agreement was reached to reform the directive.\n\n**Commissioner Ylva Johansson** presented the agreement as essential for addressing Europe's skills shortages, noting that \"Europe needs skilled workers at all levels: low, medium and high. With this agreement, we welcome the highly-skilled workers we need. Nearly 60% of businesses in Europe say they cannot find people with the right IT skills\" [Johansson, 2021-09-14]. She outlined improvements including lower entry requirements, more realistic salary thresholds, enhanced mobility between Member States, and faster family reunification.\n\n**Javier Moreno S\u00e1nchez** (S&D) emphasized that \"Europe must increase legal forms of migration and, above all, facilitate the arrival of workers who can contribute to the development of our continent\" [Moreno S\u00e1nchez, 2021-09-14]. He highlighted specific improvements in the directive: extending eligibility to beneficiaries of international protection, establishing salary ranges, reducing the minimum employment contract duration to 6 months, recognizing professional experience for IT workers, and improving intra-EU mobility.\n\n**Tatjana \u017ddanoka** (Verts/ALE) supported the compromise despite hoping \"for a more ambitious text of this Blue Card Directive, especially in what concerns social protection of card-holders and their families\" [\u017ddanoka, 2021-09-14]. She praised equal treatment provisions, better protection of family life, and the inclusion of refugees, but expressed concern about asylum seekers remaining excluded and Member States maintaining parallel national schemes.\n\n**Se\u00e1n Kelly** (PPE) viewed the reform as \"a positive step forward in making the Blue Card scheme more attractive\" through clarification of admission criteria and more user-friendly procedures [Kelly, 2021-09-14]. He emphasized that attracting foreign talent would complement EU efforts to develop a competitive workforce for green and digital transitions.\n\n**Sylvie Guillaume** (S&D) endorsed the directive, stating, \"I wholeheartedly support any initiative that emphasizes the positive role of migration\" [Guillaume, 2021-09-14]. She argued that creating more legal migration channels helps reduce irregular migration flows and breaks smugglers' influence.\n\n**Ramona Strugariu** (Renew) welcomed the directive as bringing \"more harmonised, more attractive and less bureaucratic rules\" [Strugariu, 2021-09-14]. She emphasized equal treatment and procedural safeguards while advocating for more ambitious approaches to legal migration in the future.\n\n**Damian Boeselager** (Verts/ALE) celebrated improvements to the Blue Card, particularly for IT professionals who \"can apply for the Blue Card even without a university degree, making this Blue Card the ultimate European tech visa\" [Boeselager, 2021-09-14]. He urged quick implementation and further improvements to labor migration pathways.\n\n**Assita Kanko** (ECR) supported the directive as balanced, stating \"Our EU is in danger of missing the boat when it comes to attracting these highly talented and educated people\" [Kanko, 2021-09-14]. She valued that Member States could retain their national systems while addressing labor market needs.\n\n**Pernando Barrena Arza** (The Left) supported the directive as a positive step but called for extending migration policies to include low and medium-qualified workers and creating safe routes for vulnerable groups.\n\nSeveral MEPs opposed the directive, with **Nicolaus Fest** (ID) arguing that lowering qualification standards would lead to social dumping. **Peter Kofod** (ID) expressed concern about the directive being used to increase broader immigration. **Kostas Papadakis** (NI) criticized the EU's migration policy as exploitative. **\u00c1d\u00e1m K\u00f3sa** (NI) suggested the directive represented hypocritical \"brain drain,\" stating \"The brain drain by the US, i.e. the lure of the most skilled European professionals overseas, has been opposed by the EU for as long as it is itself preparing to do the same\" [K\u00f3sa, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Bal\u00e1zs Hidv\u00e9ghi** (NI) argued that \"Immigration has a major impact on a country's culture and identity and can bring about a radical transformation of European societies, so what is needed here is not common European rules and stronger Brussels powers, but to give the right of decision back to the Member States\" [Hidv\u00e9ghi, 2021-09-14]. He advocated for family support policies rather than immigration.\n\n**Gilles Lebreton** (ID) suggested that \"To resolve this demographic crisis, the EU is making the mistake of seeking to encourage emigration, whereas it would be far preferable to encourage birth policies\" [Lebreton, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Joachim Stanis\u0142aw Brudzi\u0144ski** (ECR) welcomed the decision not to include applicants for international protection while emphasizing Member State competence on migration.\n\n**Cyrus Engerer** (S&D) framed the directive as an economic necessity rather than merely a left-wing policy, noting that \"the European Union is losing \u20ac74 billion annually due to lack of legal pathways for third-country workers\" [Engerer, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Radan Kanev** (PPE) emphasized that \"It is paramount for the EU to become, once again, the most attractive labour market in the world\" and that \"Human capital is the only key to achieve it\" [Kanev, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Henna Virkkunen** (PPE) called for cutting red tape and speeding up the Blue Card process, suggesting that applications should be processed within weeks rather than months or years.\n\n**Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar** (S&D) celebrated the directive as a breakthrough \"after tense years of arm wrestling with the Council, with three years of deadlock, finally a step in the right direction!\" [L\u00f3pez Aguilar, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Brando Benifei** (S&D) supported the directive while noting it was \"partially satisfactory\" because \"we needed to be more ambitious by creating a single European instrument to replace national ones\" [Benifei, 2021-09-14].\n\n**Eugen Tomac** (PPE) endorsed the reform as \"a necessary measure, it is a reform that millions of citizens around the world have been waiting for\" [Tomac, 2021-09-14], emphasizing the need for clarity and reducing bureaucracy.\n\nThe debate revealed a clear divide: most S&D, Renew, Greens/EFA, PPE, and ECR members supported the directive as a necessary step to attract talent and address skills shortages, while ID and some NI members opposed it, citing concerns about immigration expansion, social dumping, and loss of national control over migration policy."}
