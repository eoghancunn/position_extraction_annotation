{"summary": "# Executive Summary: Presentation of the Programme of Activities of the Portuguese Presidency\n\n## 1. Debate Information\n\n**Date:** January 20, 2021  \n**Number of Contributions:** 53 (38 fully documented contributions)  \n**Topic:** Presentation of the programme of activities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union  \n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThis parliamentary debate focused on the Portuguese Presidency's program for the first half of 2021, featuring contributions from representatives of various political groups who addressed the Presidency's priorities, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Presidency's Program\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Costa presented Portugal's Council Presidency program under the motto \"Time to act: for a fair, green and digital recovery,\" outlining three main priorities: economic recovery following the pandemic, implementing the European Social Pillar, and strengthening Europe's strategic autonomy while remaining open to the world. \n\n\"The recovery must be based on investments and reforms that allow us to emerge from this crisis more resilient, greener and more digital than we were before this crisis.\" [Costa, 2021-01-20]\n\nCosta emphasized implementation rather than creating new strategies, supporting the European Green Deal, Climate Law, digital market reforms, and social protections. He proposed concrete actions including fast-tracking ratification of recovery instruments, advancing the Digital Services Package, and hosting a Social Summit in Porto.\n\n### COVID-19 Response and Vaccination\n\nMultiple parliamentarians highlighted vaccination coordination as an immediate priority. Dacian Ciolo\u0219 stated: \"We need to make 2021 the year of rebirth, and to do that, there is no miracle, we need to overcome the pandemic, and to do that, every European must have rapid access to a safe and effective vaccine.\" [Ciolo\u0219, 2021-01-20]\n\nSven Giegold called for coordinated European action regarding COVID-19 mutations: \"We now need a binding synchronization of corona policy in Europe, i.e. a common step-by-step plan with measures that are as uniform as possible with the same incidence values.\" [Giegold, 2021-01-20]\n\nNicola Procaccini and others raised concerns about inequitable vaccine distribution among member states, while Kati Piri addressed global vaccine inequality: \"A world in which two thirds of the population will have no access to COVID-19 vaccines by 2022 is unacceptable.\" [Piri, 2021-01-20]\n\n### Economic Recovery and Financial Instruments\n\nThe implementation of the EU recovery funds and Next Generation EU dominated numerous interventions. Siegfried Mure\u0219an emphasized urgency: \"Money needs to arrive to people in need, to enterprises in need, to regions, very soon.\" [Mure\u0219an, 2021-01-20]\n\nMarco Zanni criticized the delayed implementation and problematic conditionalities: \"The only non-political institution in the European Union is the one that has really acted quickly and effectively, the European Central Bank, and this clearly raises an issue of democracy.\" [Zanni, 2021-01-20]\n\nVarious speakers disagreed about fiscal approaches. Paolo Borchia argued against fiscal constraints: \"For the sake of the peoples of Europe I hope that yours will be a humble presidency, because humility means being able to reflect on how inadequate the dogmas on the budget are for getting out of this crisis.\" [Borchia, 2021-01-20]\n\nEugen Jurzyca countered with calls for fiscal responsibility: \"It is not free money. They are resources that we will be paying back for decades with new European taxes.\" [Jurzyca, 2021-01-20]\n\n### Social Dimension and Inequalities\n\nIratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez questioned the Recovery Fund's priorities: \"Why does the Recovery Fund set a minimum of 37% for green investments or 20% for the digital transition and makes no reference to a threshold for social spending and health systems?\" [Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, 2021-01-20]\n\nManon Aubry highlighted the social emergency: \"13,000 job cuts at Airbus, 10,000 at IBM, 2,300 at Michelin, 2,000 at Sodexho. I could go on enumerating this sordid list of social plans for hours, as the social crisis is raging throughout Europe.\" [Aubry, 2021-01-20]\n\nThe Porto Social Summit was widely anticipated, with Carlos Zorrinho noting: \"Responding to citizens' needs is a humanist duty and the antidote to populism.\" [Zorrinho, 2021-01-20]\n\n### Green and Digital Transitions\n\nThe Portuguese Presidency's commitment to advancing the European Green Deal and digital agenda received broad support with some caveats. Yannick Jadot criticized support for the Mercosur agreement: \"Since 2000, the year the negotiations with Mercosur began, 5.5 times the surface area of Portugal has been deforested in the Amazon.\" [Jadot, 2021-01-20]\n\nPhilippe Lamberts called the Mercosur treaty a \"disaster for the climate and biodiversity, as it would increase deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions.\" [Lamberts, 2021-01-20] \n\nFrancisco Guerreiro questioned CAP alignment with climate goals: \"The common agricultural policy is not just 34% of the Multiannual Financial Framework. It is a fundamental policy for complying with the European Green Deal.\" [Guerreiro, 2021-01-20]\n\nOn digital policy, several speakers emphasized the need for balancing innovation with rights protection. Malik Azmani focused on the Digital Services Act to \"create a safer digital space while protecting user rights and ensuring business competition.\" [Azmani, 2021-01-20]\n\n### Migration and Rule of Law\n\nTomas Tob\u00e9 called for breaking the political deadlock on migration: \"For the European Union, for our citizens and for the migrants, the moment of truth is here. We need a common European approach to migration.\" [Tob\u00e9, 2021-01-20]\n\nMigration approaches divided the Parliament. Peter Lundgren expressed concern about vaccination passports \"potentially dividing people into categories.\" [Lundgren, 2021-01-20] Gunnar Beck opposed the migration pact, claiming it \"normalizes migration.\" [Beck, 2021-01-20]\n\nKinga G\u00e1l argued against using rule of law mechanisms as political tools: \"We expect a guarantee from the Portuguese Presidency that the rule of law inquiry will not become an instrument of blackmail.\" [G\u00e1l, 2021-01-20]\n\n### International Relations\n\nMultiple speakers focused on the EU's global positioning. Gerolf Annemans criticized the EU-China investment agreement: \"Democracy in Hong Kong has been completely decapitated, and what does Europe do? Europe goes sweet on an investment agreement.\" [Annemans, 2021-01-20]\n\nGeert Bourgeois proposed \"adding an EU-US summit to the agenda\" and supported pursuing trade treaties \"with additional commitments to sustainability and forest management.\" [Bourgeois, 2021-01-20]\n\nM\u00e1rton Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si emphasized fairness in EU decision-making: \"We just cannot afford to have winners and losers of European cooperation.\" [Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si, 2021-01-20]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed broad agreement on the urgency of pandemic response and economic recovery, but significant disagreements on implementation methods, fiscal approaches, migration policy, and international trade agreements. The Portuguese Presidency faces the challenge of balancing immediate crisis management with longer-term priorities of green and digital transitions while addressing social concerns."}
