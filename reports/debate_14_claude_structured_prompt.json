{"summary": "# Executive Summary: The Rise of Right-Wing Extremism and Racism in Europe (in Light of Recent Events in Rome)\n\n## 1. Debate Information\n\n**Date:** October 20, 2021  \n**Number of Contributions:** 35 substantive contributions from MEPs and Commissioners  \n**Topic:** The rise of right-wing extremism and racism in Europe, with specific reference to recent violent incidents in Rome where neo-fascist groups attacked the headquarters of CGIL (Italian trade union)\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe European Parliament debate on right-wing extremism revealed deep divisions on the nature, extent, and appropriate response to extremism in Europe. The discussion was sparked by attacks on the CGIL trade union headquarters in Rome by neo-fascist groups, but expanded to address broader concerns about extremism across Europe.\n\n### Context and Triggering Events\n\nThe debate centered on an October 9, 2021 incident in Rome where neo-fascist groups, including Forza Nuova, infiltrated protests against COVID-19 Green Pass requirements and attacked the headquarters of CGIL, Italy's largest trade union. Commissioner Dalli and several MEPs drew historical parallels to Mussolini-era fascist attacks on trade unions.\n\n\"It had been since 1922, that is, a few months before the advent of the fascist regime, that a union headquarters in Italy had not been attacked by extremist groups.\" [Nicola Danti, 2021-10-20]\n\n### Perspectives on the Nature and Severity of Right-Wing Extremism\n\n**Position 1: Right-wing extremism represents a serious and growing threat to European democracy**\n\nMultiple speakers, particularly from S&D, Renew, Greens/EFA, and The Left, argued that right-wing extremism is increasing across Europe, with violent manifestations like the Rome attack representing just the visible tip of a larger problem.\n\nCommissioner Helena Dalli emphasized that extremism has become mainstream: \"Hatred, violence and intolerance are not only hiding in the dark corners of the web or in the inner circles of clandestine organisations. They have become more and more mainstream and risk erupting into public violence and undermining the stability of our democracies.\" [Helena Dalli, 2021-10-20]\n\nBrando Benifei (S&D) called for specific action against neo-fascist groups, stating: \"Neo-fascist and neo-Nazi formations, such as Forza Nuova and others, must be disbanded.\" [Brando Benifei, 2021-10-20]\n\n**Position 2: Concern about right-wing extremism is exaggerated and politically motivated**\n\nSpeakers from ID, ECR, and some NI members argued that left-wing extremism poses a more significant threat, citing Europol data. These speakers portrayed the debate as politically motivated rather than based on objective threat assessment.\n\nNicola Procaccini (ECR) stated: \"There is no escalation of right-wing extremism in Europe, let alone in Rome.\" [Nicola Procaccini, 2021-10-20] \n\nPaolo Borchia (ID) questioned the debate's focus: \"Dear leftist colleagues, why don't you call for a debate on these incidents as well and stop treating this House as if it were your backyard?\" [Paolo Borchia, 2021-10-20]\n\nStefania Zambelli (ID) cited specific data: \"To talk about the danger of fascist violence in Italy, when according to the latest Europol report on political violence in Europe, as many as 24 politically motivated attacks took place in Italy in 2020 and all of them are from the extreme left, is absolutely misleading.\" [Stefania Zambelli, 2021-10-20]\n\n### Factors Contributing to Extremism\n\nSpeakers identified several contributing factors to the rise of extremism:\n\n1. **Economic insecurity and inequality**: Marc Botenga (The Left) highlighted Italy's economic decline: \"Italy today is the only country in the European Union where people are living worse than 30 years ago, workers are earning less than 30 years ago.\" [Marc Botenga, 2021-10-20]\n\n2. **COVID-19 pandemic**: An\u017ee Logar (Council) noted that \"intolerance, hatred, and extremism in Europe\" had been \"exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\n3. **Online radicalization**: Multiple speakers pointed to the internet as an amplifier of extremist ideologies.\n\n4. **Normalization of extreme rhetoric**: Several speakers argued that mainstream political parties have normalized extreme positions. Salima Yenbou stated: \"We've normalized violence, racism and hatred to such an extent that even Marine Le Pen is no longer the most radical candidate in France.\" [Salima Yenbou, 2021-10-20]\n\n### Proposed Responses to Extremism\n\nSpeakers offered varied proposals for addressing extremism:\n\n**Legal and enforcement measures:**\n- Disbanding neo-fascist organizations (Benifei, Bonaf\u00e8)\n- Extending EU crime definitions to include hate speech and hate crimes (Dalli)\n- Quick removal of terrorist content online (Dalli)\n\n**Digital regulation:**\n- Digital Services Act to address illegal online content (Logar, Dalli)\n- Joint conference on combating hate crime online (Logar)\n\n**Social and educational approaches:**\n- Education and public debate to improve democratic resilience (Logar)\n- Addressing economic inequality and social exclusion (Smeriglio, Botenga)\n- Cultural education on historical memory (Danti)\n\n**Political approaches:**\n- Clear democratic stance against all forms of extremism (Kuhnke)\n- Not forming alliances with right-wing extremist parties (Incir)\n- Equal condemnation of violence from all political sides (Gy\u0151ri)\n\n### Areas of Consensus and Division\n\nDespite polarization, some areas of limited consensus emerged:\n\n1. **Condemnation of violence**: Most speakers condemned political violence, though disagreed on which forms represent the primary threat.\n\n2. **Need for coordinated response**: There was recognition that extremism requires responses at multiple levels of governance.\n\nAreas of significant division included:\n\n1. **Definition and prevalence of extremism**: Disagreement over whether right-wing or left-wing extremism poses the greater threat.\n\n2. **Role of mainstream politics**: Disagreement on whether traditional right-wing parties enable extremism or are unfairly associated with it.\n\n3. **Free speech vs. hate speech**: Different positions on where to draw the line between legitimate political expression and extremist rhetoric.\n\nThe debate reflected broader European tensions around identity, security, and political expression, with speakers' positions largely aligning with their political groups. While there was general condemnation of the specific violent events in Rome, the debate revealed fundamental disagreements about how to characterize and respond to extremism in its various forms."}
