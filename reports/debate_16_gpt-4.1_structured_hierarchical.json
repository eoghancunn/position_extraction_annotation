She specifically highlighted in-egg sexing as a ready-to-deploy solution and pressed the Commission for decisive action.\n\n**Tilly METZ (Verts/ALE):**  \nRejected lengthy transitions, urging that \u201cthe killing is inhumane and completely incompatible with European animal welfare law\u201d [Metz, 2023-05-11]. She joined calls for a ban \u201cwithout exceptions\u201d and minimal delay.\n\n**P\u00e4r HOLMGREN (Verts/ALE):**  \nStressed public backing by noting \u201cat least 80% of EU citizens find this cruel killing for profit inexcusable\u201d [Holmgren, 2023-05-11] and underscored the moral imperative for an \u201cexemption-free, total ban.\u201d\n\n**Michal WIEZIK (Renew):**  \nDemanded both an \u201cimmediate EU-wide ban\u201d and targeted rules to close loopholes, cautioning that \u201cif there is no EU ban, chicks will be exported to countries that allow killing\u201d [Wiezik, 2023-05-11].\n\n**Se\u00e1n KELLY (PPE):**  \nDescribed the practice as \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201cbarbaric,\u201d adding \u201cit is time for the EU to act in line with its stated values recognizing animal sentience\u201d [Kelly, 2023-05-11].\n\n**Clare DALY (The Left):**  \nPainted the practice as \u201chorrific, wanton cruelty\u201d impacting \u201c330 million day-old chicks annually\u201d [Daly, 2023-05-11]. She called for import bans on products from non-compliant countries to avoid undermining EU law.\n\n**Sirpa PIETIK\u00c4INEN (PPE):**  \nZeroed in on hypocrisy in animal welfare standards, stating: \u201cwe\u2019d never accept such practices with pigs, cows, or pets\u2014it\u2019s wrong and a huge waste\u201d [Pietik\u00e4inen, 2023-05-11]. Demanded a defined timeline from the Commission.\n\n#### Moral and Technological Emphasis\n\n**Carmen AVRAM (S&D):**  \nFramed culling as fundamentally \u201cabout morality, not just legislation,\u201d calling for \u201cEU money\u2026 to support research and swift industry transition\u201d [Avram, 2023-05-11]. She stressed public outcry and the need for \u201cdirect investment before new regulatory mandates.\u201d\n\n**Niels FUGLSANG (S&D):**  \nPressed for pre-hatch sexing technology: \u201cIn-ovo sexing adds zero cost to industry or consumers, so widespread adoption should be an immediate solution\u201d [Fuglsang, 2023-05-11].\n\n---\n\n#### Support for Reform With Economic/Regulatory Considerations\n\n**Valdis DOMBROVSKIS (European Commission):**  \nAcknowledged \"the killing of day-old chicks raises serious ethical and animal welfare issues,\" but emphasized \u201cbalanced action\u201d guided by \"impact assessments and a phased approach\" [Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11]. He referenced the need to avoid \u201cmarket distortions,\u201d especially for sensitive subsectors (like foie gras), and underlined Commission support for innovation.\n\n**Anna ZALEWSKA (ECR):**  \nUrged a \u201ccareful review of current regulations,\u201d referencing \"support for agricultural entrepreneurs\" and best practices in innovator countries. Stated, \u201cWe must investigate each case\u2026 and analyze how to support entrepreneurs who implement innovations\u201d [Zalewska, 2023-05-11].\n\n**Angel DZHAMBAZKI (ECR):**  \nArticulated a skeptical view of overregulation: \u201cAll your very concerned raises of issues\u2026 usually lead to regulations\u2026 red tape\u2026 and destruction of some branch of European industries\u201d [Dzhambozki, 2023-05-11]. Expressed potential for increased imports from regions with poorer welfare standards.\n\n---\n\n#### Industry and Sectoral Safeguards\n\n**Joachim KUHS (ID):**  \nCondemned culling but cautioned: \u201cWe should not use welfare as a pretext for banning the entire poultry sector\u201d [Kuhs, 2023-05-11]. Instead, argued the solution must \u201ctarget the practice, not destroy the industry.\u201d\n\n---\n\n#### Concerns About Policy Integrity and Lobbying\n\n**Mick WALLACE (The Left):**  \nBlamed \u201cBig Agri\u201d for perpetuating the practice and voiced suspicion that reforms \u201cget watered down by industry lobbying,\u201d demanding \u201crobust policies that stand up to corporate pressure\u201d [Wallace, 2023-05-11].\n\n---\n\n### Themes of Consensus\n\n- **Overwhelming Ethical Opposition:** Widespread condemnation of the practice as inhumane and inconsistent with EU values and public sentiment.  \n- **Technological Readiness:** Broad support for \u201csexing in the egg\u201d and similar alternatives, seen as cost-effective and already used in some Member States (e.g., Germany, France).\n- **Need for Harmonization:** Cross-party agreement that only an EU-wide ban can prevent regulatory loopholes and market distortions.\n\n---\n\n### Areas of Caution or Disagreement\n\n- **Speed and Scope:** Disagreement over immediate vs. gradual implementation, and whether to exempt culturally sensitive industries (notably foie gras producers).\n- **Economic Transition:** Caution urged toward sudden reforms that could \u201cincrease unemployment, raise food prices, or invite undercutting by non-EU imports\u201d [Dzhambozki, 2023-05-11].\n- **Policy Capture Risks:** Concerns that \u201clegislation will be undermined by industry lobbying\u201d [Wallace, 2023-05-11].\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table of Speaker Positions\n\n| Speaker                | Position/Proposal                                                  | Key Quote / Point                                                                                  |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| C.

The Commission\u2019s next steps should integrate clear legal bans, robust sectoral supports, and safeguards against regulatory dilution."}
