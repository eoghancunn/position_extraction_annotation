Executive Summary\n\n### Overview\nThe debate on May 11, 2023, brought together various members of the European Parliament to address the significant issue of chick and duckling culling within the EU. The discussion included insights from Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, and Valdis Dombrovskis. Each speaker contributed a unique perspective highlighting different aspects such as economic implications, lobbying influences, and legislative processes.\n\n### Speaker Contributions\n\n#### Clare Daly [Daly, 2023-05-11]\n**Issues Addressed:** Clare Daly highlighted the systemic culling of male chicks and female ducklings by gassing and grinding. She criticized this practice as economically driven, with no regard for animal welfare, describing it as \"horrific, wanton cruelty.\"\n\n**Position:** Daly strongly supports an immediate EU-wide ban on such practices, emphasizing that economic considerations should not overshadow moral obligations to prevent animal suffering.\n\n**Arguments:** Daly argued against using economic impact assessments to justify or delay a ban. She emphasized the unnecessary nature of this practice and its failure to align with moral standards: \"There\u2019s no need for this barbaric practice.\"\n\n**Proposals:** Her proposal included a full EU-wide prohibition on chick and duckling killing, coupled with import bans from countries where such culling occurs. Additionally, she suggested Member States consider banning foie gras production.\n\n#### Mick Wallace [Wallace, 2023-05-11]\n**Issues Addressed:** Wallace focused on the role of large agri-producers in the mass killing of day-old chicks and ducks, pointing out that small farmers are not typically involved. He highlighted how industry lobbying undermines initiatives like the farm-to-fork strategy.\n\n**Position:** Wallace supports a stringent EU-wide ban, ensuring legislation is immune to dilution by agricultural lobbyists.\n\n**Arguments:** His main argument centered on past failures where animal welfare proposals were weakened due to industry influence. Wallace emphasized the need for robust legislative safeguards: \"What scope will be in place to ensure it cannot be watered down by exemptions lobbied by the big agri-industry as well?\"\n\n**Proposals:** He proposed a comprehensive ban, incorporating measures to prevent dilution through lobbying.\n\n#### Valdis Dombrovskis [Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11]\n**Issues Addressed:** Dombrovskis discussed the inclusion of chick and duckling killing prohibition in revising EU animal welfare regulations. He recognized its significance for the impact assessment process.\n\n**Position:** He supported incorporating this issue into legislative revisions, reflecting the high importance the EU attaches to animal welfare.\n\n**Arguments:** His argument focused on aligning new regulatory proposals with existing commitments to enhance animal welfare within the EU: \"The very fact that you included this issue on today\u2019s agenda speaks to the importance you attach to it.\"\n\n**Proposals:** Dombrovskis mentioned ongoing collaborative efforts with the European Parliament and Council to revise regulations, ensuring they address this critical issue.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n- Clare Daly condemned the practice as \"horrific, wanton cruelty,\" noting that \"330 million day\u2014old chicks annually, and millions of day\u2014old female ducklings\" are killed because they lack economic value [Daly, 2023-05-11].\n  \n- Mick Wallace highlighted the need for legislation resistant to industry lobbying: \"The mass killing... is not carried out by small farmers, but by big agri-producers,\" stressing that legislative measures should not be weakened [Wallace, 2019-05-11].\n\n- Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized the importance of addressing this issue within new regulations, reflecting a commitment to animal welfare: \"We are currently working on the proposals for the European Parliament and the Council to revise the EU\u2019s animal welfare regulation\" [Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate underscored a shared consensus among speakers on the need for an EU-wide ban on chick and duckling killing. While differing in their emphasis\u2014ranging from economic impacts to lobbying influences\u2014all participants agreed on the moral necessity of legislative action. The inclusion of this issue in new regulatory proposals highlights the EU's commitment to enhancing animal welfare standards."}
