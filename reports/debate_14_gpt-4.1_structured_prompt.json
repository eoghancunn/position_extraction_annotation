Debate Information\n\n**Date:** 20 October 2021  \n**Number of Contributions:** 38 (with substantive input from 36 speakers)  \n**Topic:** The rise of right-wing extremism and racism in Europe, with focus on recent violent events in Rome.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe European Parliament convened an extensive debate following the violent attack by far-right groups on the CGIL trade union headquarters in Rome. The discussion addressed the broader context of right-wing extremism, racism, and related threats to democracy in Europe. Contributions strongly diverged between those calling for urgent, robust action against right-wing extremism and those challenging the focus or framing of the debate.\n\n**A. Calls for Decisive Action Against Right-Wing Extremism and Racism**\n\nA broad coalition of representatives (including An\u017ee Logar, Helena Dalli, Javier Zarzalejos, Brando Benifei, Nicola Danti, and others from S&D, Renew, Greens/EFA, and The Left) asserted that the rise of right-wing extremism and racism represents a deepening challenge to European democracy, minorities, social cohesion, and foundational EU values.\n\n- **Key Issues Identified:** \n  - Increase in intolerance, hate crimes, and extremist violence.\n  - Growing mainstreaming of hate, conspiracy theories, and disinformation.\n  - Specific threats and attacks against minorities, migrants, Muslims, Jewish communities, and LGTBI people.\n  - Exploitation of pandemic-induced social anxieties by extremist groups.\n\n- **Core Positions:**  \n  - **Zero tolerance** for extremism, racism, and fascist violence.\n  - The threat extends beyond marginal groups, infiltrating mainstream politics (supported by cases of ambiguous or inadequate condemnation by some right-wing leaders).\n  - A **united, cross-party front** and strong societal response are necessary: \u201cWe need to give a strong signal of intransigence toward violence ... that should unite all democratic political forces of the right and left without ifs and buts\u201d [Nicola Danti, 2021-10-20].\n  - EU values and democracy are at stake: \"There can be no compromise on combating violent extremism, racism, and xenophobia. We need a prompt and comprehensive response\" [Helena Dalli, 2021-10-20].\n\n- **Arguments & Evidence:**  \n  - Reports from Europol and other agencies indicate a rise in hate crimes and extremist incidents.\n  - Recent events in Rome are symptomatic, not isolated, and reflect a broader trend.\n  - Historical analogies to the genesis of fascist movements and cautions about societal indifference (e.g., warnings by Holocaust survivors cited).\n\n- **Policy and Action Proposals:**  \n  - Legislative actions, including stricter enforcement and extension of EU hate crime laws; adoption of the Digital Services Act.\n  - Ban and disband neo-fascist and neo-Nazi organizations: \u201cNeo-fascist and neo-Nazi formations, such as Forza Nuova and others, must be disbanded\u201d [Brando Benifei, 2021-10-20].\n  - Institutional initiatives (e.g., EU Anti-Racism Action Plan, strategies against antisemitism).\n  - Investment in **education, media literacy**, and **public dialogue** to build democratic resilience and counter radicalization.\n  - Stronger support for minority and vulnerable groups; binding protections against hate crimes.\n  - Political actors urged to unequivocally distance themselves and refuse alliances with extremist groups.\n  - Societal and cultural campaigns\u2014\u201cdeep cultural operation of memory, especially for the youngest\u201d [Nicola Danti, 2021-10-20].\n\n**B. Critiques of the Debate\u2019s Framing and Claims of Double Standards**\n\nA significant contingent (notably from ID, ECR, and some NI members) questioned the narrow focus on right-wing extremism.\n\n- **Main Challenges Raised:**\n  - The debate is \u201cinstrumental, decontextualized and biased ... most of the cases of violence originated from left-wing groups, not right-wing groups, but this was not taken into account\u201d [Paolo Borchia, 2021-10-20].\n  - Calls for equal attention to left-wing extremism, anarchist violence, and Islamic radicalism; frustration over what was seen as a lack of balance in public and parliamentary discourse.\n  - Use of parliamentary debate for perceived ideological battles rather than balanced discussion of all forms of political and religious extremism.\n\n- **Core Positions:**  \n  - All violence, regardless of political origin, must be condemned (\u201cextremism, on both sides, must be condemned strongly\u201d [Raffaele Fitto, 2021-10-20]).\n  - Reference to Europol and Eurojust data suggesting left-wing attacks predominate in recent Italian cases; critique of \u201cunjustly tarnishing Italy's image\u201d [Stefania Zambelli, 2021-10-20].\n  - Rejection of the stigmatization of opponents as \u2018far right\u2019 as a means to marginalize dissent (\u201cwhen you label them extreme right-wingers, you're trying to disqualify the only defenders of freedom, democracy, and sovereignty\u201d [Jean-Lin Lacapelle, 2021-10-20]).\n  - Calls for the EU to focus on \u2018real problems\u2019 such as economic challenges, energy, and migration, rather than an allegedly exaggerated extremist threat.\n\n- **Proposals:**\n  - Level the debate: \u201cthat this House ... finally apply a level playing field ... to reject aggression from the right and the left equally\u201d [Enik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri, 2021-10-20].\n  - Avoid political instrumentalization and focus on factual data.\n  - Address deeper economic and social causes of unrest rather than only addressing extremism superficially.\n\n**C. Structural and Social Causes; Broader Policy Needs**\n\nSome speakers (notably Marc Botenga, Kostas Papadakis, and Sira Rego) highlighted social and economic grievances as underlying factors driving extremism.\n\n- **Analysis:**  \n  - Right-wing extremism thrives on economic insecurity, inequality, and institutional failures.\n  - The far right \u201cdiverts people\u2019s anger ... against first the migrants, now the trade unions,\u201d deflecting anger from \u201cthe real perpetrators of this social crisis ... governments ... [and] those big companies\u201d [Marc Botenga, 2021-10-20].\n  - EU and state institutions bear responsibility for policies that breed alienation and scapegoating.\n\n- **Proposals:**  \n  - Strengthening the social state, employment protections, and fair economic policy.\n  - Reforming EU and national government approaches that fuel exclusion and discontent.\n  \n**D. Emphasis on Political and Moral Clarity**\n\nNumerous speakers demanded explicit political and moral clarity from all parties:\n\n- **Non-Normalization Principle:** \u201cFascism ... is not an opinion. It is a crime\u201d [Evin Incir, 2021-10-20].\n- **Parliamentary Responsibility:** \u201cWe elected representatives have a special responsibility to be at the forefront of the fight against racism and extremism\u201d [Alice Kuhnke, 2021-10-20].\n- **Call for Non-Ambiguity:** Urgent requests for parties\u2014especially those on the right\u2014not to equivocate or downplay the gravity of the threat, and to sever any connections with extremist groups.\n\n**E. Other Perspectives**\n\n- **Historical Responsibility:** Miroslav Rada\u010dovsk\u00fd highlighted Eastern European vigilance in preventing Western-origin extremist ideologies from resurfacing.\n\n- **Role of Law Enforcement:** Concerns about the management of demonstrations, with Ignazio Corrao warning about conflating violent actions of known extremists with legitimate protest movements.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusions and Next Steps**\n\nThe debate revealed a fundamental divide:\n\n- **Majority Position:** A significant number of MEPs and the Commission urge decisive, collective, and cross-society action to address the clear and present danger of right-wing extremism and racism, advocating zero tolerance, political bans, educational initiatives, and stronger protection for minorities.\n- **Critical Minority:** Others question the selective attention and call for broader condemnation of all extremism, warn against political instrumentalization, and urge focus on root socioeconomic causes.\n\n**Recommended Actions for Decision-Makers:**\n- Prioritize cross-party unity and robust enforcement of existing and proposed EU measures against hate crimes and extremist groups.\n- Demand unequivocal political condemnation of all extremist violence and ideologies; resist normalization or relativization.\n- Implement targeted educational and cultural initiatives to counter radicalization.\n- Maintain a balanced, fact-based approach in public discourse, while not shying away from confronting visible threats.\n- Address social and economic factors that contribute to vulnerability to extremist narratives.\n- Continue monitoring and reporting on all forms of extremism, ensuring institutional responses adapt to evolving realities.\n\nThe debate demonstrates urgent concern, but also underscores the necessity for honest, principled, and nuanced engagement across Europe\u2019s political spectrum.\n\n---"}
