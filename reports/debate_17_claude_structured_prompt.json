{"summary": "# Executive Summary: Gender Aspects of the Rising Cost of Living and the Impact of the Energy Crisis\n\n## Debate Information\n**Date:** January 17, 2024  \n**Number of Contributions:** 25 substantive contributions (from a total of 28 speakers listed)  \n**Topic:** Gender aspects of the rising cost of living and the impact of the energy crisis  \n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe European Parliament debate focused on how the rising cost of living and energy crisis disproportionately affects women across Europe. Speakers addressed structural gender inequalities, gendered impact of economic policies, and proposed solutions ranging from gender-mainstreaming in policymaking to concrete economic interventions.\n\n### Key Issues Identified\n\n**Disproportionate Gender Impact:** Lina G\u00e1lvez Mu\u00f1oz, the rapporteur, emphasized that \"There are twenty million more women than men in the European Union living below the poverty line\" [G\u00e1lvez, 2024-01-17]. This statistic was referenced by multiple speakers, including Commissioner Schmit, who noted women's economic vulnerability stems from structural factors: \"Women's gross hourly earnings are on average 12.7% below those of men, and for women aged over 65, their pensions are on average 29% lower than those of men\" [Schmit, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Energy Poverty:** Alice Kuhnke highlighted that \"50-125 million Europeans [are] unable to afford proper indoor heating\" [Kuhnke, 2024-01-17], with women disproportionately represented in this group. Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe noted that \"Nearly 30% of the households in Ireland are living in energy poverty\" [Cuffe, 2024-01-17], while Isabella Adinolfi pointed out that \"over 41 million people have faced winter without adequate heating in their homes\" [Adinolfi, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Single Mothers' Vulnerability:** Several speakers highlighted the particular challenges faced by single-parent households, predominantly headed by women. Commissioner Schmit stated that \"Almost half of lone mothers are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Women represent 85% of all one-parent families in the EU\" [Schmit, 2024-01-17]. Hel\u00e9ne Fritzon noted that \"In my country, Sweden, one in three single mothers is in the red every month\" [Fritzon, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Economic Disparity:** Beyond energy costs, Maria Walsh addressed the \"pink tax\" where \"products and services marketed to women cost more than identical items marketed to men\" [Walsh, 2024-01-17]. Chris MacManus highlighted how \"The childcare system in Ireland is on its knees, with families paying akin to a second mortgage each month\" [MacManus, 2024-01-17], forcing many women out of the workforce.\n\n### Positions Taken\n\n**Pro-Gender Specific Approach:** Most S&D, Greens/EFA, Renew, and The Left speakers advocated for gender-specific policies. Kuhnke argued that \"A green transition that is socially fair and leaves no woman behind, is an absolute prerequisite for the success of the Green Deal and for a gender equal European Union\" [Kuhnke, 2024-01-17]. Marc Angel called for \"European legislation that guarantees fair transitions, inclusive transitions, but also gender-sensitive transitions\" [Angel, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Gender-Neutral Approach:** Several ECR and ID members opposed gender-focused solutions. Ladislav Il\u010di\u0107 argued against \"dividing society into generations\" and identity groups, suggesting that \"most Europeans live in a community and there they incur the costs of life\" [Il\u010di\u0107, 2024-01-17]. Margarita de la Pisa Carri\u00f3n and Maria Veronica Rossi criticized what they characterized as ideological approaches to practical problems.\n\n**Economic System Critique:** Sandra Pereira and other Left members criticized the broader economic model, contrasting \"the struggles of women and families with the 'astronomical profits' of large economic groups\" [Pereira, 2024-01-17]. Annika Bruna criticized EU energy policies, arguing for \"lifting sanctions on gas and oil imports\" [Bruna, 2024-01-17].\n\n**EU Policy Defense:** Commissioner Schmit defended EU actions, stating \"It's not Europe that caused the energy crisis, others did\" and highlighted EU initiatives to address energy poverty [Schmit, 2024-01-17].\n\n### Key Arguments\n\n**Gender Blindness in Policy:** Kuhnke criticized the Commission's Green Deal and energy policies for being \"gender blind\" [Kuhnke, 2024-01-17]. Silvia Modig argued that \"gender impact assessment of all legislation\" is needed [Modig, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Structural Inequalities:** Multiple speakers identified how women's overrepresentation in low-paid care sectors, part-time work due to caregiving responsibilities, and gender pay gaps create systematic vulnerability. Radka Maxov\u00e1 noted that \"women's vulnerability stems from structural inequalities including wage gaps, their concentration in underfunded care and social sectors\" [Maxov\u00e1, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Ideological Divide:** Several speakers from ID and ECR groups questioned the framing of the debate along gender lines. Maria Veronica Rossi opposed \"using the energy crisis as an opportunity to promote gender ideology\" [Rossi, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Energy Sovereignty:** De la Pisa Carri\u00f3n proposed \"energy sovereignty so that each Member State can obtain a generous autonomy at a good price for all\" [De la Pisa Carri\u00f3n, 2024-01-17]. Adinolfi criticized \"the EU's energy policy for creating speculation by pegging electricity prices to gas prices\" [Adinolfi, 2024-01-17].\n\n### Policy Proposals\n\n**Gender Mainstreaming:** Incorporation of gender impact assessments, gender-disaggregated data, and gender indicators in EU energy and Green Deal policies was proposed by multiple speakers. Commissioner Schmit supported \"urging Member States to define and assess energy poverty with gender aspects in their national energy plans\" [Schmit, 2024-01-17].\n\n**Economic Measures:** Several concrete economic interventions were proposed:\n- Guaranteeing adequate minimum wages and income (Mario Furore)\n- Regulating prices of essential goods (Sandra Pereira)\n- Returning energy utilities to public ownership (Sandra Pereira)\n- Creating an EU-funded renovation loan scheme prioritizing at-risk families (Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe)\n- Implementing the directive on pay transparency (Commissioner Schmit)\n- Strengthening access to affordable and energy-efficient housing (Elena Kountoura)\n\n**Labor Market Reforms:** Proposals included fighting job precariousness, increasing women's participation in green transition sectors (where they represent only 32% in renewable energy and 10% in construction according to Commissioner Schmit), and improving childcare access to enable workforce participation.\n\n**Energy Market Reform:** Several speakers, particularly from ECR and ID groups, called for energy market reform and reconsideration of sanctions affecting energy prices.\n\nThis debate highlighted the complex intersection of gender, energy policy, and economic justice, reflecting varying perspectives on how to address the disproportionate impact of the cost of living and energy crises on women throughout the European Union."}
