Debate Information**\n\n- **Date:** 20 January 2021\n- **Number of Contributions:** 53\n- **Topic:** Presentation of the programme of activities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union\n\n---\n\n**2. Executive Summary**\n\nThe debate on the programme of activities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union took place at a critical moment for Europe, defined by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and pressing challenges relating to health, economic recovery, digital and green transitions, democracy, and global influence. The Portuguese Presidency, represented by Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa, set out a comprehensive, ambitious plan under the banner: \u201cTime to act: for a fair, green and digital recovery.\u201d\n\n**Core Priorities and Approaches**\n\nSpeaker Ant\u00f3nio Costa opened the debate with a call for coordinated action on pandemic response, inclusive recovery, and the European Green and Digital agendas, while reinforcing social rights, rule of law, and strategic autonomy. He proposed \"ensuring successful COVID-19 vaccination and accelerating ratification of the Next Generation EU and Multiannual Financial Framework; implementing the European Green Deal and adopting the new Climate Law; advancing the Digital Services Package for digital rights and competition; hosting a Social Summit in Porto to push forward the EU Social Pillar\" [Costa, 2021-01-20].\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed these points, focusing on the need to update the EU\u2019s \"social rule book\" to match rapid societal and technological changes and warning that blanket border closures are counterproductive. She commended the \"best choice\" of collective European vaccine procurement, asserting: \"Staying united at 27 on vaccines was the best choice... All 27 Member States are on that list\" [von der Leyen, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Health Crisis and Pandemic Response**\n\nA cross-party consensus emerged for the swift, equitable rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and a science-driven, unified approach to health measures. Manfred Weber stressed, \"We do not want first and second class Europeans on this continent. We are all equal and had the chance to access the vaccine at the same time\" [Weber, 2021-01-20]. Sven Giegold and Paulo Rangel each called for binding, pan-European coordination on pandemic measures, with Giegold urging: \"We now need a binding synchronization of corona policy in Europe, i.e. a common step-by-step plan with measures that are as uniform as possible\" [Giegold, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Economic Recovery: Fairness, Investment, and Rules**\n\nSpeakers from multiple groups called for an ambitious, socially inclusive economic recovery that leverages the EU\u2019s unprecedented financial packages. Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez argued for suspending outdated fiscal rules: \"We should suspend fiscal rules until 2023 and use this time to reform them, introducing, for example, the golden rule for social investments\" [Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, 2021-01-20]. Dacian Ciolo\u015f emphasized investing in a recovery that is \"green, digital, fair and forward-looking\" [Ciolo\u015f, 2021-01-20], while Pelayo Rangel and Siegfried Mure\u015fan highlighted the need for rapid, transparent disbursement of funds and strict oversight to prevent misuse.\n\nSome expressed skepticism regarding conditionalities. Marco Zanni challenged the relevance of the Stability and Growth Pact in the recovery context: \"There are conditions that, in my opinion, clash both with what is the program of the Costa presidency and with what is the vision. I think you need the courage to change...\" [Zanni, 2021-01-20]. Paolo Borchia warned, \"If there is not the common sense to understand that conditionalities are a trap at a historical stage like this, then the risks of becoming a noose around our necks\" [Borchia, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Social Dimension: \u201cNo One Left Behind\u201d**\n\nA central theme was the elevation of the EU Social Pillar and tailored support where inequalities have deepened. Many, like Pedro Marques and Simona Bonaf\u00e8, urged governments not to repeat post-crisis austerity: \"If ten years ago there was money for the banks, all that was needed, now let's not cut the legs out from under the workers...\" [Marques, 2021-01-20]. Manon Aubry called for a \"state of social emergency\" [Aubry, 2021-01-20], while Sandra Pereira and Carlos Zorrinho pushed for \"rapid mobilization of resources... without imposing conditionalities that interfere with sovereign decisions\" [Pereira, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Green Deal, Digital Transition, and Agriculture**\n\nMany hailed the Presidency\u2019s intention to combine digital and climate action, but critics, notably Philippe Lamberts, Yannick Jadot, and Jos\u00e9 Gusm\u00e3o, warned that trade deals like Mercosur may undermine these goals: \"This project, if ratified, would be a disaster for the climate and biodiversity, as it would increase deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions\" [Lamberts, 2021-01-20]. Francisco Guerreiro and Eric Andrieu urged deep CAP reform aligned with the Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy to secure resilient, sustainable agriculture and food systems.\n\n**Rule of Law, Democracy, and Institutional Reform**\n\nVarious speakers stressed the importance of upholding European values. Katalin Cseh warned, \"Further appeasement of and concessions to autocrats will only embolden them and make Europe weaker\" [Cseh, 2021-01-20]. Both Terry Reintke and M\u00e1rton Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si called on the Portuguese Presidency to stand firm on democracy, minority rights, and transparent decision-making.\n\nThe launch of the Conference on the Future of Europe surfaced as an urgent priority for institutional renewal, with Guy Verhofstadt stating, \"We need this conference urgently and I count on you, Prime Minister, to achieve that in the Council in the coming weeks if possible\" [Verhofstadt, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Migration, Borders, and Global Engagement**\n\nMigration generated division, with broad support for EU-wide management but deep differences over quotas, solidarity, and external partnerships. Tomas Tob\u00e9 advocated: \"All Member States need to contribute in some way\" [Tob\u00e9, 2021-01-20], while Kinga G\u00e1l warned against \"mandatory immigration quota[s] ... not a solution in any form\" [G\u00e1l, 2021-01-20]. Gunnar Beck and Philippe Olivier called for major treaty changes and democratic mandates before advancing a new migration pact.\n\nThe Presidency\u2019s ambition for strong external relations, including summits with the US and India, as well as strategic autonomy, received support from Geert Bourgeois and Kati Piri. Piri articulated, \"It requires the global leadership to stand up to China, to hold Russia to account and to rebuild our transatlantic and multilateral ties\" [Piri, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Tensions and Dissent**\n\nSignificant dissent came from several quarters. Speakers from ID, ECR, and The Left questioned the recovery plan\u2019s conditionalities, the scope of green spending, digital regulation, perceived EU overreach, and trade orientations. On the Mercosur deal, both environmentalists and some farmers\u2019 advocates expressed opposition, warning it would \"betray European farmers, as well as [be] dangerous for our... environment\" [Bay, 2021-01-20].\n\n**Actionable Recommendations**\n\n1. **Health**: Accelerate coordinated vaccination, propose a European binding pandemics response plan.\n2. **Recovery**: Ensure rapid, transparent deployment of funds with active monitoring for value and efficiency; consider temporary reform or suspension of fiscal rules linked to social investments.\n3. **Social**: Center all policies on reducing inequality, with special focus on youth, employment, gender, and anti-discrimination.\n4. **Green/Digital**: Align CAP reform, digital regulation, and recovery funds with climate and biodiversity goals; revisit trade agreements with environmental implications.\n5. **Rule of Law/Democracy**: Prioritize defense of rule of law and minority rights, reinforce transparency, and ensure the Conference on the Future of Europe is citizen-driven.\n6. **Migration**: Seek consensus on a new pact balancing solidarity and flexibility.\n7. **External Relations**: Organize summits with key partners, critically reassess problematic agreements, and integrate sustainability and rights protections in trade.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Portuguese Presidency faces a pivotal period, marked by urgent expectations across public health, economic stability, social resilience, and global leadership. While broad support exists for \u201ca fair, green, and digital recovery,\u201d debate revealed sharp differences on implementation, priorities, and the balance between solidarity and sovereignty. Moving forward, success will depend on reconciling these perspectives, delivering rapid results, and reinforcing EU unity and credibility through transparency, inclusion, and effectiveness."}
