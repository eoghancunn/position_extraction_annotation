{"summary": "# Executive Summary: The European Forest Strategy - The Way Forward\n\n## Debate Information\n- **Date**: October 6, 2020\n- **Topic**: The European Forest Strategy - The Way Forward\n- **Number of Contributions**: 52 speakers contributed to the debate, representing various political groups and perspectives\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis parliamentary debate addressed the future European Forest Strategy, highlighting the tension between environmental protection and economic interests, while exploring forests' multifunctional roles in climate action, biodiversity preservation, and rural economies.\n\n### Key Issues and Positions\n\n**Balanced Approach vs. Environmental Prioritization**\n\nPetri Sarvamaa (PPE), the rapporteur, advocated for \"an ambitious and self-standing EU forest strategy\" that would take \"a balanced approach between the economic, ecological and social sustainability of forests\" [Sarvamaa, 2020-10-06]. This position was echoed by many PPE members, including Jessica Polfj\u00e4rd who emphasized that \"forests and the forestry industry stand for climate benefits, but also for hopefulness\" [Polfj\u00e4rd, 2020-10-06].\n\nCommissioner Janusz Wojciechowski supported this balanced approach, stating that \"the forest strategy will need to have a strong protection and restoration dimension in strong cooperation with foresters and local communities\" [Wojciechowski, 2020-10-06]. He outlined plans for \"planting at least three billion additional trees in the EU by 2030\" while promoting innovation in the sector.\n\nIn contrast, members of the Greens/EFA group, including Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg, argued for prioritizing environmental protection, stating \"The European Union must take more responsibility for its forests\" and \"We urgently need forest conversion towards more resilient and species-rich stands that can store water better\" [Deparnay-Grunenberg, 2020-10-06]. Thomas Waitz added that \"Anyone who takes the fight against the climate crisis seriously cannot ignore the role of forests\" [Waitz, 2020-10-06].\n\n**Forest Management Competence: EU vs. Member States**\n\nSeveral speakers emphasized that forestry should remain primarily a national competence. Karin Karlsbro (Renew) stated that \"Forestry is therefore best decided locally and must remain a national competence\" [Karlsbro, 2020-10-06]. Gilles Lebreton (ID) strongly opposed EU-level management, arguing that \"forest management is not an area that the Treaties have entrusted to the European Union\" [Lebreton, 2020-10-06].\n\nConversely, Clara Aguilera (S&D) supported \"a European forestry strategy with ambition that will be transferred to future regulations at the European level so that the current national management of forestry policy can give way to European management\" [Aguilera, 2020-10-06].\n\n**Forest Condition and Protection Measures**\n\nMany speakers highlighted the poor condition of European forests. Delara Burkhardt (S&D) noted that \"Only 15% of the forest habitat is in good condition\" [Burkhardt, 2020-10-06], a statistic repeated by several speakers. Michal Wiezik (PPE) warned that \"European forests are not doing well. The majority of them are not in good shape. Europe desperately needs a good forest strategy\" [Wiezik, 2020-10-06].\n\nCarmen Avram (S&D) called for specific protection measures: \"We need to implement an effective and unbeatable timber traceability system at European level immediately\" and \"We urgently need to define, identify and protect what is left of Europe's virgin forests with the utmost rigour\" [Avram, 2020-10-06].\n\n**Economic Importance and Rural Development**\n\nSeveral speakers emphasized the economic importance of forestry. Francisco Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Mon highlighted that \"Forests are also a way to boost the necessary economic reactivation after the COVID-19 pandemic\" [Mon, 2020-10-06]. Beno\u00eet Lutgen identified the \"economic challenge, which is a determining factor for three million individuals and families in Europe\" [Lutgen, 2020-10-06].\n\nHerbert Dorfmann focused on mountain forests, stating that \"Only if they are regularly rejuvenated can they fulfill this protective function, and these forests are often used to produce high-quality timber and are also important suppliers of energy\" [Dorfmann, 2020-10-06].\n\n**Active Management vs. Strict Protection**\n\nUlrike M\u00fcller (Renew) argued against strict protection, stating \"I reject the idea of turning forests into strict protected areas. Forests are not static natural history museums\" [M\u00fcller, 2020-10-06]. Simone Schmiedtbauer similarly advocated that \"We need active, multifunctional forest management that is sustainable and takes biodiversity into account\" [Schmiedtbauer, 2020-10-06].\n\nJutta Paulus (Greens/ALE) countered this view, arguing that \"Our forests are first and foremost habitats, carbon reservoirs and natural climate systems that are already under enormous stress as a result of climate change\" [Paulus, 2020-10-06].\n\n### Major Proposals\n\n1. **Forest Protection Measures**: Defining and protecting primary and old-growth forests, implementing effective timber traceability systems, and halting illegal logging.\n\n2. **Climate Action**: Planting at least 3 billion additional trees by 2030, promoting forest conversion toward more diverse and resilient stands, and recognizing forests' role as carbon sinks.\n\n3. **Economic Development**: Promoting innovation in wood products as alternatives to fossil-based materials, supporting the forest-based bioeconomy, and ensuring economic viability of forestry in rural areas.\n\n4. **Integration with Other Policies**: Linking agroforestry to the Common Agricultural Policy, aligning with the European Green Deal and Biodiversity Strategy, and coordinating across EU forest-related initiatives.\n\n5. **Governance Framework**: Creating a balanced EU Forest Strategy that respects member state competencies while providing coordinated guidance on sustainable forest management.\n\nThe debate highlighted that forests are at the intersection of climate policy, biodiversity protection, and economic development, with speakers advocating for varying degrees of intervention, protection, and utilization according to their political positions and national contexts."}
