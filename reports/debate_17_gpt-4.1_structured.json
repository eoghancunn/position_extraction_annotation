Executive Summary\n\n**A. Overview of Key Issues**\n\nVirtually all speakers acknowledged that the rising cost of living, persistent inflation, and the energy crisis have exacerbated poverty across the EU, with women\u2014particularly single mothers, elderly women, and women in precarious employment\u2014being most acutely affected. The debate highlighted structural gender inequalities like the gender pay and pension gaps, overrepresentation of women in low-paid sectors, the burden of unpaid care work, inadequate access to essential services (health, education, care), and specific pricing discriminations such as the \"pink tax.\"\n\n**B. Main Positions and Perspectives**\n\n#### **Support for Gender-Responsive Policy Action**\n\nSpeakers including Alice Kuhnke, Nicolas Schmit, Lina G\u00e1lvez, Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe, Sandra Pereira, Maria Walsh, Hel\u00e9ne Fritzon, and others, delivered strong, consistent calls for structural solutions integrating gender considerations at every policy level.\n\n- **Alice Kuhnke** criticized current EU frameworks as \"completely gender blind,\" arguing that \"poverty has a female face\" and demanding \"the use of intersecting data and a gender-responsive approach as pillars of EU policymaking\" [Kuhnke, 2024-01-17].\n- **Nicolas Schmit** stressed the urgency for Member States to define and assess energy poverty using gender-sensitive indicators and highlighted the heightened risks for lone mothers, advocating for \"targeted structural policies and reinforced monitoring\" [Schmit, 2024-01-17]. He reiterated in two interventions that supporting vulnerable women with aid and accelerating renewable energy transitions is fundamental [Schmit, 2024-01-17; 25].\n- **Lina G\u00e1lvez** reinforced the argument that \"poverty has the face of a woman with her children,\" making the case for guaranteed access to \"decent employment, decent housing, affordable energy and access to services\" [G\u00e1lvez, 2024-01-17].\n- **Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe** pressed for \"an EU-funded renovation loan scheme to prioritise at risk families and we have no time to lose\" [Cuffe, 2024-01-17].\n- **Sandra Pereira** focused on wage increases, regulation of essential goods, and ending precarious work, arguing, \"measures are needed that respond to the problems experienced by women, but also to their aspirations, the defense of their rights and the promotion of equality\" [Pereira, 2024-01-17].\n- **Maria Walsh** brought attention to the \"pink tax,\" characterizing it as a discriminatory practice contributing to period poverty, stating, \"no one should bear a price tag for their gender, and it is time to put an end to pink tax too\" [Walsh, 2024-01-17].\n- **Hel\u00e9ne Fritzon** demanded urgent cost-lowering measures and energy security, calling it \"totally unacceptable\" that \"in one of the richest continents in the world\" single mothers face severe hardship [Fritzon, 2024-01-17].\n\nKey recommendations across these speakers included:\n- **Implementation of gender impact assessments in policy design and evaluation**\n- **Collection and utilization of gender-disaggregated data**\n- **Ensuring equal access to energy and essential services**\n- **Investing in care infrastructure, housing, and energy-efficient renovations**\n- **Direct financial aid and minimum income directives, with dedicated support for women-led and single-parent households**\n- **Targeted measures against discriminatory pricing (\"pink tax\")**\n\n#### **Critiques of Current EU Energy and Economic Policy**\n\nSome speakers critiqued the EU policy response and its ideological basis:\n- **Isabella Adinolfi** condemned the structure of European energy markets, arguing that pegging electricity prices to gas prices \"has generated unacceptable speculative conditions\" and called for \"practical and immediate solutions\" [Adinolfi, 2024-01-17].\n- **Margarita De La Pisa Carri\u00f3n** and **Annika Bruna** viewed the crisis as worsened by \"ideologized environmental objectives\" and EU-imposed sanctions, advocating for increased Member State sovereignty over energy policy: \"we need energy sovereignty so that each Member State can obtain a generous autonomy\" [De La Pisa Carri\u00f3n, 2024-01-17]; \"freeing member states from current EU energy market rules\" [Bruna, 2024-01-17].\n- **Maria Veronica Rossi** rejected the focus on \"gender ideology\" and the creation of new bureaucracies, arguing these do not deliver \"effective solution[s] to the energy problem\" [Rossi, 2024-01-17].\n- **Ladislav Il\u010di\u0107** critiqued policies dividing society by gender/minority status, proposing instead to \"adapt policies to real-life groups and communities\" [Il\u010di\u0107, 2024-01-17].\n\n#### **Structural and Social Policy Emphasis**\n\nSpeakers including Sandra Pereira, Mario Furore, Vilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, Silvia Modig, Radka Maxov\u00e1, Elena Kountoura, Romana Jerkovi\u0107, and Chris MacManus prioritized broader social policy interventions:\n- **Sandra Pereira** demanded regulation of essential goods, return of energy to public control, and expansion of public services [Pereira, 2024-01-17].\n- **Mario Furore** and **Vilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117** called for minimum wage and income directives and national anti-energy poverty measures prioritizing women and children [Furore, 2024-01-17; Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, 2024-01-17].\n- **Elena Kountoura** and **Silvia Modig** linked gender equality directly to access to affordable utilities, social services, and the need for comprehensive gender impact assessments [Kountoura, 2024-01-17; Modig, 2024-01-17].\n- **Romana Jerkovi\u0107** proposed a \u20ac100 billion EU aid package for single parents and additional elderly protection measures [Jerkovi\u0107, 2024-01-17].\n- **Chris MacManus** highlighted the lack of affordable childcare as a key driver of women\u2019s vulnerability, advocating for \"a truly affordable childcare system in Ireland\" [MacManus, 2024-01-17].\n\n#### **Calls for Action Beyond Declarations**\n\nSpeakers like Gianna Gancia emphasized, \"our credibility does not depend only on these grand declarations of principle,\" insisting on united, practical action to address both gender and overall poverty [Gancia, 2024-01-17].\n\n**C. Areas of Significant Agreement**\n\n- Consensus on the **existence of a pronounced gendered impact of both crises**\n- Widespread support for **gender-responsive policies, assessments, and data collection**\n- Broad agreement that **measures to tackle energy poverty, housing, essential services, and wage gaps are urgently needed**, with strong calls for targeted financial aid and the expansion of public infrastructure\n\n**D. Core Divisions**\n\n- Contestation over the **degree of EU versus Member State responsibility and sovereignty** in energy and economic policy (criticized by Adinolfi, De La Pisa Carri\u00f3n, Bruna, Rossi, Il\u010di\u0107)\n- Disagreement about the **value and necessity of a gender-focused versus universalistic approach**\n- Divergence on the **role of \"ideology\"** in current policy proposals and the legitimacy of EU-level gender coordinators or bureaucracy\n\n**E. Actionable Policy Recommendations (Synthesized)**\n\n1. **Integrate mandatory gender impact assessments and gender-disaggregated data in all EU and national energy/social policy.**\n2. **Define and monitor energy poverty using gender-sensitive indicators, with national and EU-level reporting.**\n3. **Allocate direct and substantial financial aid to at-risk single-parent (especially female-led) households (e.g., the proposed \u20ac100bn aid package).**\n4. **Implement reforms for energy market structure and transparency, prioritizing affordability and anti-speculation.**\n5. **Expand and accelerate renovation and social housing funds, ensure prioritization for vulnerable women and families.**\n6. **Guarantee access to essential services\u2014affordable childcare, healthcare, energy, and housing\u2014with targeted frameworks for women and families.**\n7. **Introduce or reinforce minimum wage/income directives and ensure equal pay and pension rights.**\n8. **Abolish discriminatory pricing such as the \"pink tax\" and address period poverty.**\n9. **Advance public information and support projects focusing on social inclusion, especially for minority and marginalized women (e.g., the Roma).**\n10. **Ensure practical implementation, going beyond declarations to enforceable and monitored outcomes.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile perspectives diverge starkly on the role of EU policy, market mechanisms, and the value of gender-focused versus universalist measures, the weight of testimony in this debate points to an overwhelming recognition of both the reality and severity of the gendered impact of the cost of living and energy crises. The strongest policy responses combine intersectional gender analysis, robust social intervention, market reform, and enforceable guarantees for affordable living\u2014especially for women, children, and other highly vulnerable demographics.\n\n---"}
