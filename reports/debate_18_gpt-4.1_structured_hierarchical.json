Debate Information\n\n- **Date:** September 12, 2023\n- **Topic:** Combating the normalisation of far-right and far-left discourses, including antisemitism\n- **Format:** Plenary debate featuring over a dozen Member of European Parliament (MEP) contributions from all major political groups, as well as European Commission representation\n\n---\n\n### 2. Executive Summary\n\n#### Context and Framing\n\nThe European Parliament convened to address the persistent and intensifying threat of extremist rhetoric in public and political spheres, with a particular emphasis on antisemitism. The debate highlighted diverse perspectives regarding the origins, consequences, and remedies for the uptick in normalised far-right and far-left narratives. Across contributions, MEPs stressed the gravity of these developments for the core values and future of the European project.\n\n---\n\n#### Key Themes and Divergences\n\n**A. The Danger of Political Alliances & Normalisation**\n\nSeveral speakers highlighted the real-world impact when far-right (and, to a lesser extent, far-left) formations are legitimised through alliances or policy compromise:\n\n- **Sergey Lagodinsky (Verts/ALE)** warned, \u201cWe have a double responsibility in Europe, because of our past, to ensure democratic parties do not forge alliances with populists, fascists, or antisemites. This is non-negotiable\u201d [Lagodinsky, 2023-09-12].\n- **Evin Incir (S&D)** pointed to Sweden as a cautionary tale: \u201cWhen extremists are normalised, minorities like myself experience the stinging pain of exclusion. Mainstream parties must never bargain with the far right for political gain\u201d [Incir, 2023-09-12].\n\n**B. Impact on Democracy and Vulnerable Groups**\n\nParliamentarians from multiple groups described the fundamental nature of the challenge:\n\n- **Karen Melchior (Renew)** drew on European history: \u201cFrom scapegoating women, LGBTI people, and migrants, the far right\u2019s playbook is clear: attack minorities to break democracy\u2019s back\u201d [Melchior, 2023-09-12].\n- **Alice Kuhnke (Verts/ALE)** described the stakes: \u201cOur children, our pregnant mothers, feel the chill of hatred when discriminatory policies become law. Human rights must not become relative\u2014they are universal\u201d [Kuhnke, 2023-09-12].\n- **Margarida Marques (S&D)** called for unity: \u201cDemocracy\u2019s immune system depends on all democratic forces standing together, especially as the far right seeks to erode the rule of law and human rights from within\u201d [Marques, 2023-09-12].\n\n**C. The Centrality and Complexity of Antisemitism**\n\nThe debate repeatedly returned to its focal point\u2014antisemitism\u2014emphasised as both a symptom and driver of broader extremism:\n\n- **Margaritis Schinas (European Commission)** insisted: \u201cAntisemitism is a barometer of Europe\u2019s health. One click online can become a violent act in our streets. We owe it to history to fight\u2014all of us\u201d [Schinas, 2023-09-12].\n- **Lukas Mandl (PPE)**: \u201cJewish life is not a side issue\u2014its safety is a measure of Europe\u2019s soul. If it cannot flourish here, none of us can feel secure\u201d [Mandl, 2023-09-12].\n\nA sharper focus was placed on EU foreign policy and educational funding:\n- **David Lega (PPE)** argued, \u201cWe must stop funding Palestinian textbooks spreading antisemitic indoctrination, or our anti-hate policies are hollow\u201d [Lega, 2023-09-12].\n- **Bert-Jan Ruissen (ECR)** called for \u201cstrict adherence to the IHRA definition and conditioning EU aid on the absence of antisemitic content\u201d [Ruissen, 2023-09-12].\n\n**D. Social Policy, Education, and Media Regulation**\n\nThe risk of digital and offline radicalisation was tackled through policy proposals:\n\n- **Eugen Tomac (PPE)**: \u201cYoung Europeans are targeted online by hate and propaganda. Countering digital disinformation must be a EU security priority\u201d [Tomac, 2023-09-12].\n- **Andrey Kovatchev (PPE)** added: \u201cEducation and media can be manipulated to fuel hate; we must regulate social platforms and safeguard historical truth\u201d [Kovatchev, 2023-09-12].\n- **Dietmar K\u00f6ster (S&D)** emphasised social measures: \u201cThe rise of hate is linked to poverty, exclusion, and a weakened welfare state. More social policy, not less, is the answer\u201d [K\u00f6ster, 2023-09-12].\n\n**E. The \u2018Two Extremes\u2019 Debate**\n\nThe question of whether far-right and far-left extremism should be considered equally dangerous sparked clear divisions:\n\n- **Konstantinos Arvanitis (The Left)** challenged the equivalence: \u201cEquating the far right and far left is a false narrative, a dogma that denies history and helps no one but real criminals\u201d [Arvanitis, 2023-09-12].\n- Conversely, **Nuno Melo (PPE)** warned: \u201cBoth extremes spread hate\u2014if unchecked, they will shrink our freedoms and crush our democracy\u201d [Melo, 2023-09-12].\n\n**F. Critique of the Mainstream \u2018Anti-Extremism\u2019 Narrative**\n\n- **Mathilde Androu\u00ebt (ID)** offered a dissenting perspective: \u201cThe EU risks criminalising national sentiment while ignoring real sources of antisemitism. Honest debate is being stifled by the mainstream\u201d [Androu\u00ebt, 2023-09-12].\n\n---\n\n#### Synthesis and Proposed Actions\n\n**Broad Consensus**\n- **Unified Rejection of Extremist Alliances**: Strong calls to \u201crefuse political alliances with populists, fascists, or antisemites, even if it costs votes and power\u201d [Lagodinsky, 2023-09-12].\n- **Policy Measures**: Consensus on supporting comprehensive anti-antisemitism strategies, stricter regulations for online platforms (\u201cpartner with IT companies to remove hate content\u201d [Schinas, 2023-09-12]), tying EU financial aid to anti-hate compliance, deploying robust civic education, and empowering civil society.\n- **Vigilance for Vulnerable Groups**: Urgency to \u201cmaintain universal human rights and democracy, especially for minorities under attack\u201d [Kuhnke, 2023-09-12].\n\n**Points of Disagreement**\n- Disputes on \u201cequating\u201d far-right and far-left risks, with The Left and some S&D voices advocating targeted focus on unique far-right dangers, while EPP and Renew members stressed a broader, two-front approach.\n- ID\u2019s Androu\u00ebt opposed the mainstream EU framing, contending that legitimate national identity and security debates are being conflated with extremism.\n\n---\n\n### Concluding Assessment\n\nThe debate marks overwhelming agreement that the normalisation of extremist and antisemitic discourse is an existential threat to the values on which the European Union is founded. Common ground was found in the need for resolute, integrative action that spans political, social, digital, and educational domains: \u201cThis is a fight for the heart of Europe, and there can be no ambivalence in our response\u201d [Schinas, 2023-09-12]. However, achieving consensus on definitions, the exact weight of threats, and specific remedial tactics remains a challenge requiring continuous engagement across the political and civic spectrum.\n\n---\n\n**Action Points:**\n1. Reaffirm zero tolerance for all forms of antisemitism and extremist discourse in EU institutions.\n2. Expand and regularly evaluate anti-antisemitism strategies, including comprehensive digital regulation.\n3. Condition external EU funding on explicit adherence to values and removal of hate content.\n4. Deepen educational reforms and support for civil society against hate and misinformation.\n5. Foster a political culture of \u201cdecency over power,\u201d refusing all alliances with known extremists.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared for all policymakers, civil society leaders, and stakeholders engaged in defending European democracy and pluralism.**"}
