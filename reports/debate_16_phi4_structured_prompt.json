{"summary": "# Report on the Debate: EU-Wide Ban on Chick and Duckling Killing\n\n## Debate Information\n\n**Date:** May 11, 2023  \n**Contributions:** Three main speakers addressed the issue.  \n**Topic:** The debate focused on the potential implementation of an EU-wide ban on the killing of male chicks and female ducklings in the poultry industry.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe debate centered around the ethical and regulatory implications of continuing or banning the practice of culling day-old male chicks and female ducklings, which is carried out for economic reasons in the poultry industry. This summary outlines the perspectives and proposals of Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, and Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\n### Clare Daly [2023-05-11]\n**Issue:** Daly highlighted the systemic practice of killing 330 million day-old chicks and millions of female ducklings annually due to their lack of economic value. She described this as \"horrific, wanton cruelty\" driven by economic motives without regard for animal welfare.\n\n**Position:** Daly strongly advocates for an immediate EU-wide ban on chick and duckling killing, arguing that economic considerations should not override animal welfare.\n\n**Argument:** The primary argument revolves around the moral imperative to end this practice. Daly criticizes the EU's reliance on economic impact assessments and Member State practices in decision-making processes, asserting that \"The market trumps everything and animal welfare doesn\u2019t count\" [\"Daly, 2023-05-11\"].\n\n**Proposal:** She calls for a comprehensive ban on chick and duckling killing across the EU. Additionally, Daly suggests prohibiting imports from countries where such culling occurs and considers banning foie gras production by Member States as an extension of animal welfare concerns.\n\n### Mick Wallace [2023-05-11]\n**Issue:** Wallace discusses how the mass killing is primarily conducted by large agri-producers rather than small farmers. He underscores the role of agricultural industry lobbying in weakening legislative efforts related to animal welfare.\n\n**Position:** Wallace supports a robust EU-wide ban on the culling of male chicks and ducklings, emphasizing that legislation must resist dilution from industry influence.\n\n**Argument:** His argument highlights past instances where animal welfare initiatives were compromised due to agri-industry lobbying. He stresses that \"The mass killing of day-old chicks and ducks in the millions is not carried out by small farmers, but by big agri-producers\" [\"Wallace, 2023-05-11\"].\n\n**Proposal:** Wallace advocates for a stringent legislative approach with built-in safeguards to prevent exemptions lobbied by large agricultural industry players. He questions what measures will ensure the legislation remains strong and effective against such influences.\n\n### Valdis Dombrovskis [2023-05-11]\n**Issue:** Dombrovskis addresses the inclusion of chick and duckling killing prohibition in the revision of EU animal welfare regulations, recognizing its significance in impact assessments for new proposals.\n\n**Position:** He supports incorporating this issue into legislative revisions, acknowledging its importance to EU's commitment to animal welfare.\n\n**Argument:** The argument is based on the high priority given to animal welfare by the EU\u2019s legislative bodies. Dombrovskis notes that including this topic reflects the \"importance you attach to it\" [\"Dombrovskis, 2023-05-11\"].\n\n**Proposal:** Ongoing work with the European Parliament and Council aims to revise the EU's animal welfare regulation, assessing the impact of prohibiting the killing of day-old chicks. This demonstrates a legislative commitment to addressing this issue comprehensively.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, all speakers agree on the necessity of banning the practice due to ethical concerns but differ in emphasis: Daly focuses on immediate action against economic motivations; Wallace highlights resistance to agri-industry lobbying; Dombrovskis underscores the legislative process and priority given to animal welfare. Each speaker contributes a critical perspective towards shaping an effective EU-wide ban."}
