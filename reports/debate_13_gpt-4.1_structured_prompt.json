Cross-cutting Concerns**\n\nMany speakers stressed the need for inclusiveness, transparency, subsidiarity, and a pragmatic approach. Key proposals include:\n\n- Launching and concluding the Conference on the Future of Europe.\n- Expedited and equitable vaccine deployment.\n- CAP and climate law reforms.\n- Revising the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal rules.\n- Addressing youth unemployment and inequalities.\n- Integrating social, green, and digital agendas.\n- Building consensus within the Council on challenging dossiers (migration, enlargement, trade).\n- Protecting rights and democracy throughout the pandemic and digital transitions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate demonstrated both consensus and sharp divisions. Consensus emerged around the need for swift pandemic response, inclusive and sustainable recovery, and embedding social justice, climate action, and digital rights in all policy areas. Controversy persists over economic governance and conditionalities, migration, the ratification of the Mercosur agreement, and the balance between European integration and national sovereignty. The Portuguese Presidency has been both welcomed as a force for pragmatic renewal and challenged as needing to show greater ambition or reform orientation in critical policy areas. The Presidency is thus tasked with building unity and credibility, delivering tangible results, and steering Europe towards recovery and transformation in a period of profound crisis and opportunity.\n\n---"}
