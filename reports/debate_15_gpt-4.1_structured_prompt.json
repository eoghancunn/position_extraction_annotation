He advocated modernising education, fair minimum wages, \"the right to disconnect,\" ethical AI frameworks, and robust regulation. He stressed, \"The European digital agenda must be based on our European values and should offer opportunities for everyone\" [Ismail Ertug, 2020-02-12].\n\n**Nikolina Brnjac** emphasised adapting Europe's social model to digitalisation, balancing innovation and inclusion.

He advocated objective assessment of risks and opportunities to guide intervention: \"Both (technology and the economy) have a serving function towards people. This must also be the guiding principle for our political work in this field\" [Dennis Radtke, 2020-02-12].\n\n**Agnes Jongerius (S&D)** demanded robust social rules for platform workers, advocating fair income, decent hours, and influence over working conditions. \"Platform workers ... are asking for a fair income. They ask for normal working hours and they ask for influence\" [Agnes Jongerius, 2020-02-12], she said, calling for social EU rules in the platform economy.\n\n**Drago\u015f P\u00eeslaru (Renew)** highlighted digital skills deficits as the central challenge, proposing a public-private EU fund for mass digital literacy investment. \"Digital literacy and skills are key pillars of adapting European citizens to a labour market that is constantly transforming\" [Drago\u015f P\u00eeslaru, 2020-02-12].\n\n**France Jamet (ID)** critiqued pan-European digitalisation as a threat to sovereignty, warning of AI risks, data abuse, and prioritising national over EU priorities. She called for regulatory frameworks to protect sovereignty before deeper integration: \"AI and robotics do present risks, and we absolutely must adopt a regulatory framework\" [France Jamet, 2020-02-12].\n\n**Alexandra Geese (Verts/ALE)** condemned digital surveillance's targeting of vulnerable people, referencing automated welfare fraud detection. She urged redirecting AI to tackle tax evasion, not criminalise welfare: \"Digital systems that humiliate and spy on people have no place there\" [Alexandra Geese, 2020-02-12].\n\n**El\u017cbieta Rafalska (ECR)** stressed social protection for workers, especially in poorer and rising regions, and highlighted the need for support beyond mere regulation. \"A new professional reality \u2026 will guarantee social protection, good working conditions and social inclusion\" [El\u017cbieta Rafalska, 2020-02-12].\n\n**Leila Chaibi (GUE/NGL)** denounced platform labor exploitation and demanded that platform workers be classified as employees with full rights. \"What are we waiting for, to force platforms to recognize delivery drivers as what they really are, i.e. employees?\" [Leila Chaibi, 2020-02-12].\n\n**Lefteris Nikolaou-Alavanos (NI)** criticised EU digital policy as serving capitalist interests and called for a centrally planned, worker-controlled digital economy: \"It is only workers' power and a centrally planned economy ... that will redeem peoples from suffering\" [Lefteris Nikolaou-Alavanos, 2020-02-12].\n\n**Sara Skyttedal (PPE)** warned against overregulation threatening EU social achievements by undermining digital competitiveness: \"If the EU loses its competitiveness in the digital era due to bad regulation there will be no jobs to go to, let alone

advocating for a \"Europe of nations\" that delivers territorial digital equality and resists globalism.\n\n**Kim Van Sparrentak (Verts/ALE)** argued for the regulation of digital platforms like

creator (not destroyer) of jobs and encouraged politicians to take a positive outlook.\n\n**Ib\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Del Blanco (S&D)** called for a participatory, humanistic approach to digital literacy for all.\n\n**Se\u00e1n Kelly (PPE)** emphasized the need for high-speed broadband, attention to psychological impacts of remote work, and bridging IT skills deficits.\n\n**Maria-Manuel Leit\u00e3o-Marques (S&D)** highlighted the need to harmonise digital and social policies to ensure benefits are shared.\n\n**Paul Tang (S&D)** called for controlling data in the public interest,

Comparative Analysis\n\n**Common Threads:**  \nThere is a broad consensus on prioritising digital skills, upskilling and retraining, inclusion of vulnerable and marginalised populations, reducing inequalities (regional, generational, gender-based), worker protection (Social Europe), and upholding European values of fairness and democracy in the digital sphere.\n\n**Key Points of Divergence:**  \n- **Regulatory Emphasis:** PPE and Renew members generally advocate for balance to promote competitiveness, while S&D, Greens, GUE/NGL and parts of ECR stress stronger regulation for social justice and protection.\n- **Digital Sovereignty:** ID and NI members place greater weight on national sovereignty and criticise supranational digitalisation.\n- **Social Model Advocacy:** Left-leaning groups focus more on platform labor rights and restructuring digital capitalism; centre-right tends to emphasize opportunity, competitiveness, and skill-building.\n- **Platform Economy:** Outspoken calls for platform worker protection and fair algorithmic pay (S&D, GUE/NGL, Verts/ALE) receive less focus from liberal and right-leaning speakers, who emphasize job creation and innovation.\n\n**Concrete Proposals:**  \n- Massive investment in digital skills (multiple speakers);\n- Regulation to ensure fair taxation and labor standards for digital giants;\n- Digital right to disconnect;\n- Universal broadband and infrastructure upgrades;\n- Inclusive policies for rural, elderly, and disabled citizens;\n- Transparency and democratic oversight of AI and algorithmic systems;\n- National/local digital policies complimentary to EU-wide frameworks.\n\n---\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis parliamentary debate illustrates a strong overall commitment to forging a digital transition anchored in social justice, inclusivity, and European values. It calls for both ambitious policy-making and vigilant oversight to ensure that digital transformation enriches rather than divides European societies.\n\nThe emerging actionable imperatives include:\n- Accelerating investment in digital literacy and inclusive access;\n- Strengthening labor protections and digital rights;\n- Developing fair, transparent regulation for new digital business models;\n- Ensuring no group or region is left behind, and\n- Embedding democratic and ethical standards into the continent's digital future.\n\n---\n\n*Compiled based on 44 parliamentary interventions from the European Parliament debate on \"A Social Europe in a Digital World,\" 12 February 2020.*"}
