{"summary": "# Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Combating the normalisation of far-right and far-left discourses including antisemitism\n**Date:** September 12, 2023\n**Number of Contributions:** 22 speakers from various political groups and the European Commission\n**Venue:** European Parliament\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nThe European Parliament debate on combating the normalisation of extremist discourses revealed significant tensions among political groups regarding the nature, sources, and equivalence of far-right and far-left extremism, with particular focus on antisemitism.\n\n## Key Issues Addressed\n\n**Rising Extremism in Mainstream Discourse:** Multiple speakers expressed concern about the increasing acceptance of extremist rhetoric in mainstream politics and media. Andrey Kovatchev noted how \"Far-left and far-right statements pose a huge threat to democracy, which is obliged to build up its immune system to defend itself\" [Kovatchev, 2023-09-12].\n\n**Antisemitism:** Speakers addressed antisemitism from multiple angles, with several emphasizing its sources and manifestations. Lukas Mandl cited Austrian studies showing \"Anti-Semitism comes from the far left of the political spectrum, from the far right of the political spectrum\" [Mandl, 2023-09-12], while David Lega criticized EU funding of Palestinian textbooks containing antisemitic content.\n\n**Political Alliances with Far-Right Parties:** Several speakers, particularly from S&D and Greens/EFA groups, condemned mainstream conservative parties for forming alliances with far-right parties. Evin Incir criticized Swedish parties that have aligned with the Sweden Democrats, stating: \"Right-wing extremism has been normalized to the point where people like me who happen to be born outside the borders of the EU, who have dark hair and dark eyes, are told: 'You can't be Swedish'\" [Incir, 2023-09-12].\n\n**The Theory of \"Two Extremes\":** A major point of contention was whether far-right and far-left ideologies should be considered equivalent threats. While some speakers like Kovatchev argued \"There is absolutely no difference between a far-left communist disinformation campaign leading to hatred and a far-right Nazi racist one\" [Kovatchev, 2023-09-12], others like Konstantinos Arvanitis rejected this as \"unhistorical egalitarianism\" that dangerously legitimizes extremist ideologies.\n\n## Positions and Arguments\n\n**Center-Right (EPP):** Generally condemned both far-right and far-left extremism as equal threats to democracy. Andrey Kovatchev and Lukas Mandl highlighted the need to combat antisemitism from all sources. David Lega specifically criticized EU funding for Palestinian textbooks containing antisemitic content, asking: \"When will the Commission take anti-Semitism in the world as seriously as it does in Europe?\" [Lega, 2023-09-12].\n\n**Center-Left (S&D):** Focused primarily on the dangers of far-right extremism, with speakers like Dietmar K\u00f6ster arguing that \"As long as left and right are still simply equated, the far right will continue to gain more and more influence\" [K\u00f6ster, 2023-09-12]. Speakers emphasized social inequalities as root causes of extremism.\n\n**Liberals (Renew):** Stressed the need to protect democratic values and minority rights. Irena Joveva criticized political compromises with extremists, stating: \"It is the responsibility of those of us in the middle to reject such discourses in advance and not to compromise our policies or actions with such extremists\" [Joveva, 2023-09-12].\n\n**Greens/EFA:** Strongly condemned the normalization of far-right discourse and criticized mainstream parties for alliances with far-right groups. Sergey Lagodinsky argued that \"as democrats, we will not enter into a pact with populists, fascists or anti-Semites - even if it hurts. That is democracy\" [Lagodinsky, 2023-09-12].\n\n**Identity and Democracy (ID):** Mathilde Androu\u00ebt took a contrarian position, arguing that the debate framework itself was problematic and that \"Europeans who, on the pretext of defending their identity, culture, values, social protection, environment, security and the sovereignty of their country, are now being branded extremists\" [Androu\u00ebt, 2023-09-12]. She suggested the true source of antisemitism was immigration.\n\n**The Left:** Rejected equating far-left and far-right positions. Silvia Modig focused exclusively on far-right threats, stating \"The far right derives its power from fear and the experience of being excluded\" [Modig, 2023-09-12], while Konstantinos Arvanitis criticized the \"theory of two extremes\" as historical revisionism.\n\n**European Commission:** Margaritis Schinas emphasized that antisemitism threatens the European project itself: \"Europe was built on the ashes of the Second World War and the Holocaust. If Europe fails the Jewish people, it is the European project that will have failed\" [Schinas, 2023-09-12].\n\n## Key Proposals\n\n1. **Democratic Consensus Building:** Andrey Kovatchev called for building a democratic consensus against extremism.\n\n2. **Social Reforms and Education:** Dietmar K\u00f6ster proposed expanding the welfare state and strengthening political education to counter extremist narratives.\n\n3. **Implementing IHRA Definition:** Bert-Jan Ruissen advocated for all member states to implement the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.\n\n4. **Conditional Funding:** David Lega and Bert-Jan Ruissen proposed making EU funding to Palestinian authorities conditional on removing antisemitic content from textbooks.\n\n5. **Protection of Minority Rights:** Karen Melchior emphasized that protecting all minorities is essential for safeguarding democracy, stating \"We are not free until everyone is free in our society\" [Melchior, 2023-09-12].\n\nThe debate highlighted the Parliament's deep divisions on how to address extremism, with fundamental disagreement on whether far-right and far-left extremism pose equivalent threats. These different perspectives have significant implications for policy approaches to combating the normalization of extremist discourses in Europe."}
