Debate Information\n\n**Date:** March 15, 2023  \n**Number of Contributions:** 23 substantive contributions (from 27 total entries)  \n**Topic:** Failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the implications for financial stability in Europe\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe European Parliament debate on March 15, 2023, focused on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and its implications for European financial stability. The debate featured diverse perspectives on the causes of the failure, potential contagion risks to Europe, and necessary policy responses.\n\n### Main Issues and Causes of SVB's Failure\n\nCommissioner **Mairead McGuinness** provided context for the discussion, explaining that three US banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank) failed due to \"balance sheet management shortcomings, particularly investing depositors' funds in long-term fixed-rate assets that lost value when interest rates rose.\" [McGuinness, 2023-03-15]\n\nSeveral MEPs, including **Markus Ferber**, identified excessive liquidity created by central banks as a key factor: \"One of the main triggers for the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank was a veritable flood of liquidity.\" [Ferber, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Ernest Urtasun** and **Claude Gruffat** emphasized deregulation as a critical cause, with Urtasun noting that \"Since Trump's deregulatory measures in 2018, Silicon Valley Bank has been subject to less stringent regulatory scrutiny and requirements on the grounds of proportionality.\" [Urtasun, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Michiel Hoogeveen** attributed the failure to \"reckless behavior of policymakers and central bankers\" through years of loose monetary policy. [Hoogeveen, 2023-03-15]\n\n### EU Banking System Resilience Assessment\n\nThere was broad consensus that Europe's banking system is more resilient than the US system due to stricter regulations.\n\n**McGuinness** stated that \"The EU banking sector is in overall good shape. It has built up its resilience in recent years and it is supervised closely by national and European authorities.\" [McGuinness, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Ferber** highlighted regulatory differences: \"Here in Europe, as far as the Basel rules are concerned, even the smallest bank is just as obliged to comply with them as the largest bank - a very big difference to the USA.\" [Ferber, 2023-03-15]\n\n**St\u00e9phanie Yon-Courtin** noted that \"the emergency mechanisms and rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis are solid dikes to ensure the resilience of our European banks.\" [Yon-Courtin, 2023-03-15]\n\nHowever, **Andr\u00e9 Roug\u00e9** was skeptical of this assessment, warning that \"When Bruno Le Maire explains to the French that this crisis will not cross borders, it is reminiscent of Mme Buzyn explaining that the virus had no passport.\" [Roug\u00e9, 2023-03-15]\n\n### Monetary Policy Implications\n\nViews on appropriate ECB monetary policy diverged significantly.\n\n**Johan Van Overtveldt** and **Hoogeveen** supported continuing interest rate hikes despite banking sector stress. Hoogeveen urged the ECB to \"Continue with interest rate hikes, continue to build up banks' capital buffers, and finally implement reforms and retire debt.\" [Hoogeveen, 2023-03-15]\n\nIn contrast, **Jos\u00e9 Gusm\u00e3o**, **Antonio Maria Rinaldi**, and **Fabio Massimo Castaldo** argued for a pause in rate hikes. Gusm\u00e3o stated: \"today we know that this restrictive monetary policy is ineffective and poses multiple economic risks, including for the financial system.\" [Gusm\u00e3o, 2023-03-15] Castaldo specifically urged that \"the ECB will listen to the voice of reason and prudence, committing itself to avert further increases in interest rates.\" [Castaldo, 2023-03-15]\n\n### Regulatory Reform Proposals\n\nMultiple speakers called for completing the EU Banking Union through a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS).\n\n**Urtasun** advocated that \"If we want to reduce banking risk in Europe: common deposit insurance, reinforcement of our recovery and resolution framework and strict respect of the international Basel Framework.\" [Urtasun, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Jon\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez** proposed \"an immediate legislative proposal to revise the banking crisis management framework\" and reopening negotiations on EDIS, which \"is urgent.\" [Fern\u00e1ndez, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Irene Tinagli** emphasized: \"If we really want to strengthen the banking system and make economic policy truly independent, we have to deliver as soon as possible on one thing: the completion of the banking union.\" [Tinagli, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Danuta Maria H\u00fcbner** argued for \"an ambitious review of the EU's Crisis Management and Deposit Insurance framework\" and warned that \"politically motivated watering-down of prudential rules and safeguards must be avoided.\" [H\u00fcbner, 2023-03-15]\n\n### Startup Funding Concerns\n\n**Karen Melchior** and **Tsvetelina Penkova** highlighted concerns about startup funding in the wake of SVB's collapse.\n\nMelchior noted that \"We have the financial regulation for stability, but we also need the money for start-ups in Europe so that they stay here and that they can scale up.\" [Melchior, 2023-03-15]\n\nPenkova called for \"a more stable regulatory environment when we speak about the EU market that protects start-ups and facilitates the protection of investors.\" [Penkova, 2023-03-15]\n\n### Ideological Critiques\n\nSome MEPs used the debate to criticize broader financial system issues.\n\n**Gunnar Beck** questioned the \"impunity of these banksters\" who move between failed financial institutions without accountability. [Beck, 2023-03-15]\n\n**J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rivi\u00e8re** criticized SVB's \"investments that prioritize not profitability and security for shareholders, but issues of principle, such as global warming or diversity.\" [Rivi\u00e8re, 2023-03-15]\n\n**Rasmus Andresen** warned that \"This crisis is largely home-made. It is also a direct consequence of Donald Trump's deregulation policy\" and cautioned that Europe has \"negotiated too many loopholes in some laws.\" [Andresen, 2023-03-15]\n\n### UK-EU Financial Relations\n\n**Penkova** uniquely highlighted the need to address EU-UK financial relations: \"The European financial sector is dependent on the UK one and we need a proper deal and regulation there.\" [Penkova, 2023-03-15]\n\nOverall, the debate revealed broad consensus on Europe's stronger regulatory position compared to the US, but significant differences on monetary policy and the urgency of completing the Banking Union. Despite differing diagnoses of the cause, most speakers viewed the SVB collapse as a warning signal requiring vigilance and possible regulatory action."}
